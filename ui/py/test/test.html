      "Practitioners acknowledge the need to inform designers about user
      experiences and their context (Leonard and Rayport 1997, Buchenau and
      Fulton Suri 2000), and a number of tools and techniques have been
      presented (Fulton Suri 2003a) aiming to support designers to ‘step into
      the user’s shoes’ and ‘walk the user’s walk’ in order to design products
      that fit the user’s life"
