    <h1>Total Design: Integrated Methods for Successful Product Engineering -
      Stuart Pugh</h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Explores the notion of total design - practiced in the real world, as
      opposed to partial design - the normal way people encounter design when
      they are being taught it. The book rests on the notion that without
      specific interventions, people's partial design training will lead to
      problematic design outcomes. The book presents a very
      commercially-oriented model of design, with a strong emphasis on
      'engineering' through to sales. It has an unreconstructed view of
      information flow forward in the product design process, (though this may
      be a result of an acknowledged view of the product design in hindsight).
      It uses concrete examples of 'total design' such as&nbsp; a lifting truck,
      a wind tunnel, surgical robotics. The 'waterfall' forward design approach
      is illustrated well by the conceptual diagrams (e.g. Figure 2.2 p 32 -
      outlines a set of sources proceeding to a formal 'product design
      specification', figure 2.9 p43 shows information flow from specification
      to sales, but not back again). A set of formal analysis approaches are
      proposed; <em><strong>Parametric analysis</strong></em> - a way in which
      product design spaces can be plotted parametrically to identify
      opportunities or outliers with respect to existing competitors. <em><strong>Needs
          analysis </strong></em>is about gathering evidence of customer need.
      <em><strong>Matrix analysis</strong></em> is a tickbox representation of
      competitors' products' features.</p>
    <p>In summary 'total design' adds up to not-getting-it-wrong and doesn't
      seem to have another definition, apart from perhaps taking the series of
      proposed approaches by Pugh and simply executing all of them in sequence.</p>
    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"misdirected engineering rigour will <em><strong>always</strong></em>
      gie rise to bad total design. This implies that design teams should always
      include non-engineers....Participants should be able to see how their
      differing partial design contributions fit into the whole scene. This is
      not a desirable objective; it is considered to be essential."</p>
    <p>"an analysis of any existing product will reveal that the main design
      flow is from market (user need) to sales...this activity will be referred
      to as the 'design core'.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>"Needs analysis is concerned with establishing the true needs of the
      customer, the 'voice of the customer'. This can be obtained by extensive
      examination of the views and reports of representative bodies, market data
      publications, (buying habits), reports giving official opinions and
      reactions to products in use and also by structured interviews of customer
      questionnaires."</p>
    <p>"random approaches to ascertain customer needs...tend to leave
      fundamental gaps...particularly if the questions themselves are derived
      and driven from consideration of existing products and customers' views of
      those products rather than from fundamental needs issues."</p>
    <p>"a PDS [Product Design Specification] must be comprehensive and
      unambiguous. If an experienced designer is asked to design something with
      a less than comprehensive [specification], he will almost, without
      thinking, fill in the gaps based on his experience and feelings; if these
      happen to be at variance with the true user needs, he will be designing to
      the wrong base."</p>
    <p>"The appearance of a product is a difficult thing to specify and
      therefore, in many instances, it is left to the designer; the complaints
      come afterward" - <em><strong>analogy here with CDPF, assume it will be
          sorted by the firmware engineer.</strong></em></p>
    <p>"[product liability] legislation considers 'product defect' as its
      primary basis [but] many defects are designed into a product through lack
      of adequate consideration of all the constraints at the outset." <em><strong>he
          proposes the term 'defect of specification' for such designed-in
          problems."</strong></em></p>
    <p>"Systematic design is essential at all levels"- <em><strong>characterises
          well what he owes to Simon in his understanding of design, contra
          participatory design and divergent/convergent practices associated
          with design thinking.</strong></em></p>
    <p>"[the] tendency to 'cut and run', and start engineering and developing
      the ideas further...should be avoided at all costs" <em><strong>doesn't
          seem to take account of prototyping as a productive concept-generation
          or confirmation design activity, even though he goes on to say...</strong></em></p>
    <p>"you need as many ideas as you can possibly generate - single solutions
      are usually a disaster."<em><strong></strong></em></p>
    <p><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span>"design
      is not an excuse for trying to do impossible things outside the laws of
      physics" <em><strong>an interesting parallel concern to those who might
          specify behaviour without recognising its computational impossibility</strong></em></p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>I have a suspicion that the (mainstream field) of Service Design could
      have a lot in common with Firmware from the point of view of having
      difficulties materialising the field of work. That is to say, the holistic
      asynchronous flow of events which combine together to deliver a service
      are equally hard to concretise, although we would expect users to be able
      to describe parts accurately, drawing on their common sense, in a way
      which is perhaps impossible with firmware, because humans can be deployed
      to deliver the service.</p>

    <h1><a href="file:/papers/06e603544b3dd7fdafda434f930cd519.pdf">A Framework
        for Organizing the Tools and Techniques of Participatory Design</a></h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Made me think about upstream and downstream contributions to a
      technology, as a conceptual model for design contributions. E.g. upstream
      users, downstream developers, with some form of faithful representations
      passing along the pipeline.</p>
    <p>Their framework contrasts the following 5 interlocking concepts; <strong><em>Tools,
          Toolkits, Techniques, Methods and Approaches</em></strong>.They also
      pull out <em><strong>Form </strong></em><strong></strong>(making,
      telling, enacting)<em><strong> Purpose </strong></em><strong></strong>(why;
      for probing? for priming to a domain? to understand their experience? to
      generate new ideas?)<em><strong> and Context </strong></em><strong></strong>(group
      size, composition, face to face/online, venue)<em><strong> </strong></em>as
      key reference points. The aim is to represent various PD practices within
      a common ontology.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"There is some confusion as to which tools and techniques to use, when,
      and for what purpose. Therefore we are proposing a framework to help
      organize the proliferation of tools, techniques and methods in hopes that
      the PD community will benefit by discussing relevant applications and
      identifying potential areas for further exploration."</p>
    <p>"The main tools and techniques originating in this tradition [of
      prototyping shared artefacts] have been scenario techniques drawing on
      approaches from drama and forum theatre, design games providing materials
      and setting rules for the design dialogue and mock up and prototyping
      techniques enabling participants to jointly construct prototypes despite
      different professional backgrounds or interest in the design project."</p>
    <p>"Other traditions within participatory design have given more concern to
      how non-designers can articulate design proposals in such a way that these
      can provide a starting point for subsequent professional development
      work."</p>

        USING COOPERATIVE INTERACTIVE STORYBOARD PROTOTYPING</a></h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>They start with a design critique of a VHS and progress to the design of
      a test harness which explores experimenting with co-design of interfaces
      in real time. They claim..."By building on H y p e r C a r d we can use
      external c o m m a n d s and functions to extend possible user interaction
      modes beyond button p u s h i n g - - allowing developers to create fully
      functional interfaces such as the one we created for the PC-VCR."...but
      was it really fully-functional? Is this an example of people thinking that
      UI design is the same as software design. Did it actually record video!?
      If not, there may be many hidden aspects which weren't featured. How much
      does this matter? How can this be mitigated?</p>
    <p>They use a 'grey shade' for hiding complexity, later thought of as
      'greyed out'&nbsp; - possible link to flight instrument where various
      things can be disclosed and offered in different circumstances, and more
      information is not necessarily good (also mentioned by John Cross related
      to his Medical instruments - face to face at Manteigas event).</p>
    <p>They explicitly discuss the link to 'Scandinavian' workplace democracy -
      the precursor of Participatory Design. </p>

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"Storyboard prototyping can be defined as<br>
      ' . . . a technique designed to generate consensus and closure via a
      tangible, interactive systems concept. It permits users to participate in
      the requirements validation process, and it provides an audit trail of the
      requirements analysis process . . . . The presentation of the interactive
      storyboard to users and managers is intended to evoke comments and
      criticisms' [13, p. 39]"</p>
    <p>"Delay associated with production of the next version of the storyboard
      is a source of frustration for storyboard developers. Too much time
      between user review sessions leads to loss of cognitive momentum and can
      introduce errors to and perpetuate omissions in the development process."</p>
    <p>"[Cooperative Interactive Storyboard Prototyping] empowers users with
      tools and techniques encouraging them to interactively contribute to
      real-time, storyboard use, evalua-<br>
      tion and modification. Crucial here is the concept of the role of the user
      changing from reviewer to codeveloper."</p>
    <p>"CISP also provides situations in which users can evaluate the storyboard
      prototypes under realistic circumstances and modify them in real time."</p>
    <p>"According to Bodker and Gronbaek, a major obstacle is the developer's
      limited ability to respond smoothly to user ideas or requests for
      prototype changes during design sessions [6]."</p>

    <p>"The visually evident design object for software are their user
      interfaces (Löwgren &amp; Stolterman, 2005; Hallnäs &amp; Redström 2002),
      although there are other form factors and design objects, such as
      packaging, installation procedures, remote controls, licensing procedures,
      support and after market services, functionality and construction of
      algorithms, innovation and architectural aspects. For most software
      products, though, the design of the software is manifested through the
      usage of it (Holmlid, 2002, 2005; Bannon &amp; Bödker 1991), which in turn
      can be viewed as being mediated by its interface. At some point during
      system development the user interface will be programmed, just as the rest
      of the system."</p>
    <p>"For Loop and Hip programming is viewed as purely construction work.
      Basically this means that setting up a software development centre is
      similar to setting up an assembly factory, or acquiring production
      capacity for a component. The provisions for enabling component based
      software development is that the software can be modularized in
      components, that there is an architecture that defines the assembly of the
      components, and that there is an assembly process that directs the
      requirements for the development of components. This perspective resembles
      a traditional production-process perspective. With the position IxD argues
      for, that the design material is not like traditional industrial design
      material, the&nbsp;production-process perspective would not be accepted
      without good arguments."</p>
    <p>"if design decisions have not been made before programming time, these
      decisions will be made during programming time. This does not imply that
      programmers should be excluded from making such decisions; rather it
      implies that we need to have an interaction design strategy and direct
      design work."</p>
    <p>"some companies have succeeded with approaches such as; guidelines,
      programming design tools, design reviews, critique systems, design
      patterns, templates etc. They highlight the fact that the interaction
      design work of systems can not be dis-integrated from the development of
      the rest of the software product."</p>
    <p>"From software engineering perspectives, and thus with a focus on
      construction quality, there have been employed a varied set of methods,
      such as verification driven development, integration driven development,
      and feature based development, although<br>
      there is little said about design management aspects within these"</p>

    <title>Communities of Practice and Social Learning Systems</title>

    <h1><a href="file:/papers/122532b39d9f9071b76392f7bee38ea0.pdf">Communities
        of Practice and Social Learning Systems<br>
      </a></h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>This paper talks about 'communities of practice' as a social structure,
      which act as a foundation for 'learning' and are built around forms of
      'competence' recognised internally to the community, ways of
      participating, artefacts, perspectives and forms of knowledge. Identity
      (updated term to replace Wenger's 'belonging'), trajectory and
      multimembership are presented as features of the CoP landscape from an
      individual's point of view. It originates as an analytical tool, to
      contrast the actual dynamics of social structures to the superficial
      networks and hierarchies and wishlists of management or authority, but it
      has since become 'instrumental' as a means of engineering social
      structures.</p>
    <p>Does CDPF need to be aware of the potential for dis-identification with
      programming as an obstacle to participant engagement. What can be done to
      overcome this?</p>
    <p>The following extract seems relevant to @ShrimpingIt as well...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Managing one’s membership in existing communities: how do I contribute
        to communities I belong to or could belong to?</li>
      <li>Seeing a boundary to be bridged and becoming brokers using
        multimembership as a bridge across practices</li>
      <li>Being in a unique position to see the need for a community with the
        legitimacy to call it into being and becoming conveners</li>
      <li>Connecting someone, like a patient or a student, to a community that
        will enhance their learning capability</li>
      <li>Providing transversal connections in a context where vertical and
        horizontal accountability structures are disjointed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>Boundaries of practice - a corrolary to communities of practice,
      indicating a separation between those who are 'involved' in a negotiated
      meaning, and those who aren't. An additional, linked concept 'active
      boundaries'.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Dis-identification - rejection of the power plays and regime of
      accountability associated with a specific community.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"A community of practice can be viewed as a social learning system.
      Arising out of learning, it exhibits many characteristics of systems more
      generally: emergent structure, complex relationships, self-organization,
      dynamic boundaries, ongoing negotiation of identity and cultural
      meaning..."</p>
    <p>"we produce physical and conceptual artifacts—words, tools, concepts,
      methods,&nbsp; stories, documents, links to resources, and other forms of
      reification—that reflect our shared experience and around which we
      organize our participation" - good summary of a boundary object, within a
      community of practice</p>
    <p>"On the one hand, we engage directly in activities, conversations,
      reflections, and other forms of personal <strong><em>participation</em></strong>
      in social life. On the other hand, we produce physical and conceptual
      artifacts—words, tools,<br>
      concepts, methods, stories, documents, links to resources, and other forms
      of <strong><em>reification</em></strong>—that reflect our shared
      experience and around which we organize our participation." - reification
      is a solid link to the notion of boundary object?</p>
    <p>"Artifacts without participation do not carry their own meaning; and
      participation without artifacts is fleeting, unanchored, and
      uncoordinated."</p>
    <p>" community...participants... define a “regime of competence,” ...by
      which they recognize membership. This competence includes ...understanding
      what matters, what the enterprise of the community is, and how it gives<br>
      rise to a perspective on the world" - links to the potential to share
      programmer "gambits" with non-programmers to help them participate in code
      design.</p>
    <p>"Learning is not just acquiring skills and information; it is becoming a
      certain person—a knower in a context where what it means to know is
      negotiated with respect to the regime of competence of a community."</p>
    <p>"Engagement ...can... be a way to explore a boundary if we can have
      enough access to the practice."</p>
    <p>"The regime of competence of a community of practice translates into a
      regime of accountability— accountability to what the community is about,
      to its open issues and challenges, to the quality of relationships in the
      community, to the accumulated products of its history. When an academic
      community expects a doctoral student to contribute something new through a
      dissertation, it first expects that student to do a literature review.
      This is a way to honor the history of learning of that community. Becoming
      accountable to history also enables the student to discover the learning
      edge of the practice, the places where a contribution makes sense and is
      possible. It is this double accountability to the past and the future of
      the practice that equips the student to contribute to its evolution as a
      full participant"</p>
    <p>"my colleague Jean Lave and I coined the term “community of practice” in
      the late 80’s"</p>
    <p>"Gillian Evans (2006) has observed some kids dis-identifying with
      school-based accountability because of their accountability to other
      communities they belong to on the street"</p>
    <p>" How can the practice become the curriculum? How can it be made visible
      and inspectable? What should participants do together to learn and benefit
      from the partnership?" <strong><em>does this question relate to what
          needs to be disclosed about programming to non-programmers?</em></strong></p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;Studied a large microprocessor firm as they transformed themselves
      to be more 'user-centred' where those users were downstream adopters of
      microprocessors. Consequently some of the case studies they take on are
      actual deployments of devices using those micros.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Consequently the industrial setting is very close to that of Firmware
      engineers. They are studying the upstream teams (making processors), but
      the specific team is also involved in the study of the downstream teams
      (complicated).</p>
    <p>The examples of user engagement act as a counterexample to my hypothesis
      about firmware engineers, perhaps (e.g. in-home interviews to design
      diabetes devices) - though doesn't go as far as co-design. Of course, a
      big deal depends on how this material was consumed in downstream
      development if at all.</p>
    <p>This is a really valuable and detailed record of working practices which
      deserves in-depth analysis, even though most of the examples drift into OS
      and GUI-based design.</p>

    <p>"This thesis: (1) reviews how the user is variously applied as a
      practico-theoretical concern within human-computer interaction (HCI) and
      as an object of analysis within the sociology and history of technology;
      (2) outlines a methodology for studying users variously enacted within
      design practice; (3) examines how a non-user is constructed and
      re-constructed during the development of a diabetes related technology;
      (4) examines how designers accomplish user-involvement by way of a
      gendered persona; (5) examines how the making of a technology for people
      suffering from obesity included multiple users that served to format the
      designers’ immediate practical concerns, as well as the management of
      future expectations; (6) examines how users serve as a means for
      conducting ethnography-in-design."</p>
    <p>"The corporation in which I conducted my fieldwork is a leading
      multinational microprocessor manufacturer in the computing industry. As
      such, it is a commercial organization that pursues the research,
      development, production, marketing and standardisation of microprocessors,
      as well as various ICT technologies associated with semiconductors and
      microprocessors."</p>
    <p>"The group was internally structured into different areas of expertise,
      including: human factors, engineering and usage requirements, design
      research, software and hardware development and engineering, user
      interaction design and industrial design, user experience evaluation,
      mechanical engineering, administration and operations"</p>
    <p>"The [User-Centred Design Group] acted as a resource for the application
      of user-centered design principles and practices to innovation activities
      across the corporation"</p>
    <p>"collaborations necessarily involved the application of UCD principles in
      the development of computing technologies. Such systems included an
      interactive device to support the early detection and onset of Alzheimer’s
      disease and a fully functional computer system targeted at Chinese
      families. In both cases UCDG collaborated with different divisions within
      the corporation, and partnered with outside<br>
      organizations, such as a leading voluntary health organization in
      Alzheimer care, support and research. The group also had an ongoing
      relationship with a small team of anthropologists and ethnographers also
      working for the corporation who were engaged in the strategic<br>
      exploration of emerging microprocessor markets and usages. As a
      consequence, technologies and their associated user models and
      representations circulated amongst a variety of stakeholders and audiences
      within both the corporation and external organizations."</p>
    <p>"As a substantive starting point to this thesis, I examine the role of a
      non-user in mediating the expectations of a design team tasked with
      inventing and designing a system to enhance the management of diabetes...
      ...I examine the in-home interview and the innovation meeting in relation
      to the production, encoding and visual ordering of sociotechnical data
      that mediated the involvement of a user in the design process. I describe
      how the interview rendered an<br>
      existing patient-user in ‘thick’ ethnographic detail."</p>
    <p>"I explore how designers achieved an example of user involvement by way
      of a fictional representation of a housewife. I describe how a design
      team, again drawn from the UCDG, put together and employed a persona to
      resource the design and development of a household media management system
      intended to be used in the kitchen"</p>
    <p>"In this chapter I examine how a diverse cast of users resourced the
      construction of a prototype health and fitness technology, and how, in
      turn, the prototype served in the configuration of multiple users. The
      daily exercise prototype (DEP) – a combination of mobile phone software
      and wearable sensors – was formulated as a ubiquitous computing (ubicomp)
      technology to address the causes of obesity, as well as to allow patients
      suffering from the disease to self-manage treatment"</p>

    <p>"Human factors and design, together with user-centered processes, are
      often taken to be all there is to interaction design, but the hidden
      partner is the details of how things work when they are used. As they say,
      the devil is in the details, and this is a matter of programming."</p>
    <p>"Interactive programs are too complex for unaided human comprehension;
      instead, good user-interface-design requirements must be engineered into
      programs by rigorous, formal processes." [<em><strong>I disagree</strong></em>]</p>
    <p>"If a device “operates as designed,” it is often assumed to be designed
      correctly, even if (to more perceptive eyes) the incident is a symptom of
      bad design, a “system-induced user error.”</p>
    <p>"Why aren’t devices made consistent with best clinical practice, so that
      operator training becomes simpler, rather than the other way around? Why
      does the report say in its recommendation 10A that nurses should be
      trained that “mL” on an infusion pump means “mL per hour”[2]? Why does
      recommendation 10B ask purchasers (hospitals) to do human factors studies
      of pumps? The same answer to both questions is that for the time being
      manufacturers—and national regulatory processes—can’t be relied on, and
      hospitals therefore have to train nurses to cope with bad design."</p>

<div>"The main contribution of this paper is to make sense of Universal Design of co- creative tangibles through the concept of familiarity."
<br>
</div>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<div>"The sequential ordering does not hold for tangible interaction, where activities happen in parallel, where the activity can be distributed across multiple devices and places. The third issue is that in tangible interaction, the physical properties, characteristics, surfaces and forms of the tangible suggest its use and use possibilities."</div>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<div>"The everyday skill, or coping as Dreyfus describes, is central to what we are familiar with. The familiarity with the world is not a skill that sometimes is used, and sometimes not. It is active all the time. Hence, to be a user in the first place is to be familiar with some- thing. We do not activate this most general skill only on certain occasions, it is active all the time. Heidegger calls this capacity â€œthe sight of practical circumspec- tion. . . , our practical everyday orientation"</div>
<div>
<br>
</div>
<div>"These three concepts; involvement, understanding and unity of user-world are, according to Turner, ideas that we can use in order to investigate familiarity."</div>

    <title>Design as Bricolage: Anthropology Meets Design Thinking</title>

  <body>
    <h1><a href="../papers/1a4ce43fa07179f52d82c8370da78aa5.pdf">Design as
        Bricolage: Anthropology Meets Design Thinking</a></h1>
    <h2>Authors</h2>
    <p>Panagiotis Louridas</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>They are from UMIST&nbsp; "Information Systems Engineer Group" and
      present design as a process of bricolage - loosely, coping with an
      established inventory of materials to address a problem. They draw on the
      definition of bricolage offered by anthropologist Levi Strauss.</p>
    <p>The notion of the bricoleur's materials being signs (as opposed to the
      objects of the engineer or the concepts of the scientist, and somewhere in
      between them) offers an exciting model which allows materials the dual
      role of <strong><em>fabric</em></strong> <em>and</em> <strong><em>representation</em></strong>.
      A bricoleur is perhaps simply an alternative word for a <em>technologist</em>
      on this model.</p>
    <p>The paper as a whole ranges over art, design, engineering, science and
      human study - quite a <em>tour de force</em>.</p>
    <p>Unselfconscious design is a valuable notion - suggesting primitive
      'design' before professionalisation of the activity.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Field of Study</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>Bricolage, selfconscious design, unselfconscious design, structure and
      events, occasion execution and purpose</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"design in all its guises is a form of bricolage"</p>
    <p>"the bricoleur makes do with what’s there, with what he encounters"</p>
    <p>"the engineer and the scientist seek to go beyond the constraints,
      pertaining to a certain state of knowledge, presented to them, whereas the
      bricoleur stays within them. The engineer and the scientist break down,
      decompose and analyse; the bricoleur reorganises. The engineer and the
      scientist abstract: they create and use concepts; the bricoleur uses
      signs."</p>
    <p>"This bricoleur’s dialog with his materials and his work continues
      throughout the process, since his decisions to use something for a
      specific purpose have consequences that he cannot foresee... ...The
      bricoleur will interrogate, use, take stock, and interrogate again."</p>
    <p>"Unselfconscious design is design without designers. It is the prevalent
      form of design activity in primitive and traditional societies, in which
      design professions do not exist. Artefacts are usually manufactured and
      designed by their prospective users. Houses are designed and built by
      their inhabitants, and not by architects."</p>
    <p>"The unselfconscious designer does not conceive and does not procure new
      tools and materials for his project. The universe of the means under his
      disposal is closed and his rule of the game is to always make do with
      ‘what’s available’. He must determine which of his tools and materials are
      suitable for his purpose; he searches his inventory and chooses among the
      possible answers. He does not decompose the problem: his purpose is not to
      examine it analytically; he reorganises his materials to create the
      structure of the envisaged artefact."</p>
    <p>"the designer selects the materials from what he sees around him; it is
      tradition that determines what he sees" [very relevant to boundary object
      'selection' or 'design' - can we offer users material which they will <em><strong>see</strong></em>
      as ready-to-hand]</p>
    <p>"a designer has to integrate three kinds of events: events pertaining to
      the occasion, to the execution and to the purpose"</p>
    <p>"Unselfconscious design is design without designers, but its designs
      surpass the capabilities of many present-day professionals. The paradox is
      explained if we think that, whereas tradition limits the designer’s
      choice, and therefore limits the demands placed on him, the present-day
      designer does not have this aide...In a sense, tradition designs through
      the unselfconscious designer." [deeply relevant to choice of boundary
      objects in workshops - how do we embed 'good design' in what is offered?]</p>
    <p>"In selfconscious design tradition no longer filters occasion, execution,
      and purpose contingencies. The designer is free to resolve them and use
      them in appropriate ways. In fact, he is not only free to resolve them, he
      is also responsible to resolve them and use them in appropriate ways. Some
      innocence is lost...."</p>
    <p>"It is...imperative to find ways to handle design complexity.
      Design-by-drawing is such a way...and it is the most distinguishing
      characteristic of selfconscious design..."</p>
    <p>"The designer’s freedom and his use of diagrams set the scene for
      self-conscious design. Both of them seem to contradict the notion of
      design as bricolage: the designer’s freedom contradicts the bricoleur’s
      making do with what’s available; the designer’s use of diagrams
      contradicts the bricoleur’s immediate handling of the object of his work.
      However...[d]esign in its selfconscious guise is still a<br>
      form of bricolage...Once the designer has created his inventory, once he
      has decided on how to work and with what to work, the universe of his
      tools and materials is closed and he has to design with them."</p>
    <p>"Selfconscious design...proceeds by using analogies of the envisaged
      artefact. It uses models that are like it in some special way. Its power
      derives exactly from the power of these models. The designer can handle
      the models in ways that he could never handle the artefact. In fact, the
      designer works in the same way, but at a different level."</p>
    <p>"In literal design (i.e., unselfconscious design), the structure is the
      finished artefact. In metaphorical design (i.e., selfconscious design),
      the structure is a model of the finished artefact" [critical philosophical
      perspective for workshop design]</p>
    <p>"in a nutshell, science is concerned with discovering facts about the
      world, while design is concerned with changing the world"</p>
    <p>"It has been shown that scientists attack a problem by trying to discover
      the rule governing the situation; designers attack a problem by proposing
      solutions and reflecting on the discrepancies with the desired result;
      scientists work analytically, designers work synthetically."</p>
    <p>"Design is a tinkering using materials which the designer cannot freely
      select, and which have meanings which he cannot freely specify, in order
      to make a structure fitting the structure of the context."</p>
    <p>"The designer, like the bricoleur, does not only speak with his work, he
      also speaks through his work. There is always a personal element in
      design; and for design to be successful, the designer must recognise that
      and pour himself into the process. Design is not just a process; it is an
      affective process. The designer must make his materials disclose
      themselves; but he must also disclose himself through the design. If
      design is not affective, we do not have design any more: we have results.
      Design is this result that does something more than simply solve the
      problem; it is the result that carries some part of the designer in it." <em>[suggests
        that the choice of inventory offered up in a workshop must accommodate
        personality, be respectful or resonant with domain users' affect]</em></p>
    <p>"this jump of faith that by putting himself in a situation the designer
      will create something out of it, the letting go and the immersion, that
      the designer must accept," <em>[suggests that users expectations and
        fears would have to be managed very closely as part of the workshop
        design, to elicit engagement]</em></p>

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"three candidate accounts from design theory of what design ‘is’ are
      introduced; the conservative, the romantic, and the pragmatic"</p>
    <p>"HCI...does not recognize itself as a design discipline"</p>
    <p>"we examine in detail the concept of sketching as the archetypal activity
      of the design approach, and how it helps us grasp design work more
      properly as a kind of dialogue"</p>
    <p>"design is a matter of making; it is an attitude to research that
      involves the researcher in creating and giving form to something not
      previously there"</p>
    <p>"design-orientation by definition implies a commitment to technology and
      technological development that goes beyond critique"</p>
    <p>"the conservative account assumes that there is a ‘problem’ to be solved,
      and that descriptions of this problem can be comprehensively and
      accurately produced, if possible in the form of a structured requirements
      specification... ...A good designer in this tradition is someone who is
      able to follow prescribed action. This tends to deemphasize the role of
      the designer, striving towards a disembodied design process built on
      structured methods and externalized guidelines rather than on the skills
      and judgment of individual designers"</p>
    <p>"the romantic account of design gives prominence to the role of the
      designer. Here, they are seen as imaginative masterminds equipped with
      almost magical abilities of creation... ...In its emphasis on the
      individual, romanticism understands the key human abilities to be
      imagination over abstract reasoning and creativity over rational problem
      solving. Designers are seen as creative individuals with unusual talents,
      who often have to fight opposition in order to defend their unique
      creativity and artistic freedom... ...Hence, the romantic account...trades
      in creativity and individuality over methodology and control, aesthetics
      and individual judgment over transparency and logical reasoning. The
      content of design (the product) and the human creator (the designer) are
      accentuated, whereas the process of producing the product is opaque."</p>
    <p>"According to the pragmatic account, design is about being engaged
      directly in a specific design situation. It holds that design is always
      carried out somewhere in particular. This ‘situatedness’ locates the
      design process in a world which is already crammed with people, artifacts,
      and practices, each with their own histories, identities, goals, and
      plans.... ...design takes the form of a hermeneutic process of<br>
      interpretation and creation of meaning, where designers iteratively
      interpret the effects of their designs on the situation at hand. It is a
      reflective conversation with the materials of the design situation"</p>
    <p>"The traditional conception of the design process, strongly rooted in the
      conservative account, is to envision design work as divided into three
      distinct stages. The designer, according to this view, should first be
      involved in analyzing a problem, then in synthesizing a solution, and
      finally in evaluating the outcome... ...This layout of the design process
      has been and still is highly influential, especially for approaching
      design in the engineering disciplines."</p>
    <p>"To contrast the problems of the structured design methods, some have
      advocated the use of less formal, so-called ‘second generation’ design
      methods. [5,6] These methods—which include such activities as workshops,
      brainstorm sessions, synectics, checklists, and the use of specific
      environments to nurture creativity or for improving collaborative design
      [8, 26]—are intended to assist designers to collaborate and to be
      creative, rather than to systematize and formalize design work."</p>
    <p>"Jones [20] and Alexander [2], the founders of the<em><strong> design
          methodology movement</strong></em>, acknowledge problems with the
      design methods. While still claiming the need for such methods, Jones
      notes that there “is not much evidence that they have been used with
      success, even by their inventors.”"</p>

    <p>&nbsp;Their tripartite analysis of the requirements process is useful
      perhaps, to differentiate scope or stages in workshop processes. </p>
    <p>Their observation that RE researchers focus on the what rather than the
      how, may reveal one of the core issues here. Whilst specifying 'what' can
      appear to be a complete description, once you embark on the 'how' (having
      to implement the 'what'), other unspecified aspects emerge, which in
      practice project back onto the 'what' - e.g. interactions required in the
      device which are too complex to be feasible in the field, incorrect defaults
      which take no account of users' needs. This may link to the notion of
      'non-functional' requirements (see wikipedia).</p>

    <p>"design requirements rather than software requirements as an inclusive
      term better characterizes all requirements issues within these ecosystems
      that need to be addressed at the crossroads of business development,
      software engineering, and industrial design"</p>
    <p>"[Requirements Engineering] is replete with analytical frameworks,
      standards for requirements quality, elicitation protocols, and modeling
      methodologies"</p>
    <p>"we adopt a widely employed and straightforward categorization of the
      requirements processes into three facets: (1) discovery, (2)
      specification,<br>
      and (3) validation and verification&nbsp; During discovery, designers
      develop an understanding of the application domain and infer specific
      design needs through consultation with stakeholders and other sources
      [18]. Requirements specification is both a noun and a verb in RE parlance.
      As a noun, a specification is the document in which the requirements for a
      design effort are articulated thus representing an agreement between the
      stakeholders<br>
      and the design team [16,24]. The verb suggests the process of developing
      and managing the specification document; it is the process by which the
      design team acquires, abstracts, and represents the requirements [17,22].
      Finally, during requirements validation and verification designers ensure
      that the requirements are (1) of high quality, (2) by addressing the
      users’ needs, (3) and being appropriate for the design effort, and (4)
      having no<br>
      inconsistencies or defects"</p>
    <p>"Requirements researchers have also stated that requirements are properly
      concerned with what is to be achieved by a design artifact,<br>
      without regard to how it will be designed and implemented"</p>

        support designers in getting hold of the immaterial material of software<br>
      </a></h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Reinforces my suspicion that there's something immaterial which designers
      and users find hard to express, and underlines my choice of firmware for
      non-OS devices, where that is exactly the design domain - the bit which
      cannot be sketched. However, in the case of this paper, they are still
      operating in a domain where the foil of 'UI design' masks the lack of
      actual software specification.</p>
    <p>They look at the design of novel controls, by conceiving challenges which
      exceed the scope of existing controls, focusing on imagined 'projected'
      controls - <em>Radio</em> station controls and volume on a bedspread, <em>Shower</em>
      (flow and temperature) and <em>Stove</em> (burner and temperature)
      examples.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Mentioned reframing (different context and social environment, for
      example) triggered different solutions. E.g. Team radio - a couple in bed
      using foot controls.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"When designing novel GUI controls, interaction designers are challenged
      by the “immaterial” materiality of the digital domain; they lack tools
      that effectively support a reflecting conversation with the material of
      software as they attempt to conceive, refine, and communicate their ideas.
      To investigate this situation, we conducted two participatory design
      workshops."</p>
    <p>"Through a creative process of ideation (sketching) and iteration
      (prototyping), designers engage in a “conversation with materials” [29,
      30], striving to find harmonious intersections between what is possible,
      acceptable, needed, and desired. As designers conceive of a new idea or
      refine the details of an existing idea, the materials they use begin to
      “talk back”, revealing new opportunities and challenges. For example, when
      sketching with a pencil on paper, designers can explore a product’s
      physical form, reacting as each line is added to the page."</p>
    <p>"designers cannot easily play with the material of software, making
      development of tacit knowledge much more difficult...many interaction
      designers lack the competency to effectively implement their ideas in
      software in order to critique them [28], significantly limiting reflection
      on action. Instead, designers often find themselves handing off static,
      annotated, screen designs"</p>
    <p>"Blueprints have evolved over time into a conventional form that has
      become embedded in the practice of architecture; however, such detailed,
      conventional artifacts do not yet exist for software<br>
      development."</p>
    <p>"Framing the output as a boundary object allows the developer to become
      the voice of the software,<br>
      allowing the conversation with material to also include the transfer of
      the concept from design to development; making the transfer a co-creative
      endeavor."</p>

    <h2>Authors</h2>
    <p>Sidney C. Bailin</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>They argue that features themselves are not sufficiently rich
      representations, but mapping user stories to features allows fine-grained
      implementation questions to be answered. They report on a case study,
      which is oriented around the choice of line protocol for dispatching
      structured information between two systems. The emphasis is on a metric of
      'compression' and the fact that there are many dimensions and inconsistent
      test results which can only be picked apart by appeal to stories.</p>
    <h2>Field of Study</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"We argue that features carry a relatively small amount of semantics, if
      any at all, and that much of the intended semantics remain implicit in
      naming conventions, or tacit in experience, or undocumented in hearsay. We
      suggest that the missing semantics, addressing fine-grained questions of
      context, interface, function, performance, and rationale, can be usefully
      conveyed through stories attached to features."</p>
    <p>"There are several attributes that make something a story, but one of the
      key attributes is that of being situated. In a story, context is<br>
      (almost) everything." [Suggests context would have to be carried by my
      proposed boundary objects]</p>
    <p>"User feedback contributions, despite their unstructured form, tend to be
      highly situated and, thus, are often good examples of the notion of story
      we are advocating."</p>
    <p>"stories can be used systematically to enrich the semantics of a feature
      model. At the core of this vision lies interplay between the formal and
      the informal."</p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;They try to introduce goal-oriented processes, with Goal Cards, to
      steer investments, which are annotated with "Business Goals" [WHY], "Usage
      Goals", [HOW] "Steps" [WHAT]. Their statements below, concerning their
      Goal Cards positions them squarely as boundary objects within a software
      design process.</p>

    <p>Goal Cards, Design Rationale [they contrast their work with Louridas and
      Loucopoulos 2000]</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"In the optimal development process, every design decision would increase
      the probability that the product will generate the expected business
      value.<br>
      However, due to the fact that the focus of systems development is rarely
      the product’s quality-in-use [Ehn 1997], there is no effective way of
      telling whether the design decision will actually generate the business
      value or not. What often seems to be forgotten is that the generated
      business value corresponds to the level of usage (number of users who
      actually use the product) and the product’s quality-in-use<br>
      (effectiveness, efficiency and user satisfaction when the product is
      used). In other words, business value<br>
      is generated through product usage."</p>
    <p>"One of the biggest problems in IT development is that design decisions
      are rarely made explicit during the development of the system. This means
      that there is no description of how the imaginary product will create
      expected values that will lead to the desired business goals, i.e. which
      attributes in the product contributes to the expected values and to what
      extent. Many design decisions are made without having the product's
      quality-in-use in focus...However, there is no effective business and
      usage based technique for discussing potential design decisions, or for
      explaining the rationale behind design decisions...In [the] worst case,
      decisions are made that steers the product's presentation, behaviour and
      content away from those attributes needed to create business value."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
    <p>"In the second project, an Internet based history teaching tool, the
      project participants had extremely different backgrounds, ranging from
      artists to<br>
      programmers. In this case the primary benefit of the Goal Card was that it
      really helped the project team to form common view of the product design
      despite different perspectives."</p>
    <p>"Goal Cards differs from the concept of design rationale in the sense
      that it describes expected business and usage effects for any product
      decision, thus creating a chain of reasoning that can be reviewed by all
      stakeholders."</p>

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"How can practice-based research from humanities and informatics conjoin
      (and diverge) in the practices and analyses of digital design? Are our
      findings different from those of other, related fields, such as visual
      design or urban planning, and in which ways do our specific theoretical
      and methodological approaches contribute to this? What are the
      relationships between modes of knowing and analysis drawn from the
      insights and practices of, respectively, designers and researchers?"</p>
    <p>"Digital design calls for an expanded concept of design, as working with
      the digital is different from other forms of designing. The digital opens
      up a discussion between research approaches grounded in technological
      design and in socio-cultural and humanistic inquiries"</p>
    <p>"This also calls for a reframing of the notion of use, shifting attention
      from a narrow concept of product use to the context and practices of use.
      Design is a situated social practice, and the designed artefacts can only
      be fully understood in use. Taking into account the evolving and
      often-participatory character of digital designs, we even have to consider
      designing for design after design, the design that users carry out in use
      (Ehn 2007; Telier et al. (forthcoming)). We can also look at situated use
      as where the idea behind the artefact and the reality of use meet."</p>
    <p>"Research in PD involves users as co-designers in the design process as a
      way to design artefacts and systems that the users themselves<br>
      consider of benefit to their activities"</p>
    <p>"Understanding the contextual complexities opens up a whole range of new
      design ideas. We have to add here that foundational to PD and CSCW is a
      deep commitment to socially embedding technologies in human practice and
      that both fields of research make use of a diversity of social science
      methods, among them ethnography. There is a strong overlap with the
      humanities here"</p>
    <p>"This book attempts a reflexive exploration of the diversity of
      approaches to digital design research that we seek to confront and
      combine. The intention of this book has not been to generate a
      synthesized, grand and unified theory of (digital) design. The authors
      have different and mixed academic backgrounds: informatics, information
      systems, pedagogy, anthropology, discourse analysis, linguistics,
      semiotics (new) media studies and literary theory, among others. We
      strongly believe that this diversity is a strength when moving into
      critical and reflective analysis of digital design and its contexts of
      construction and use. None of the perspectives or theories put forward in
      this book claims priority over others. The fact that our research is
      grounded in different epistemological traditions has been one of the main
      challenges in writing collaboratively."</p>

    <p>"Thimbleby (1984) introduced the concept of generative user engineering<br>
      principles (GUEPS). These are principles having several properties:<br>
      • They apply to a large class of different systems: that is, they are
      generic.<br>
      • They can be given both an informal colloquial statement and also a
      formal<br>
      statement.<br>
      • They can be used to constrain the design of a given system: that is,

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"On the one hand, prototypes can be powerful boundary objects and an
      effective way to share ideas, collaborate and communicate across
      functional boundaries within an organization, but on the other hand the
      (lack of) ownership of prototypes also plays an important role in the
      politics and power-relations within an organization."</p>
    <p>"The developers of the interactive prototype, e.g. interaction designers,
      are in a position to design it in a way that enables<br>
      and encourages different stakeholders to take ownership over it."</p>
    <p>"I demonstrate that involving non-designers in the making and shaping of
      the prototype enables them to take active part in the reflective learning
      process of prototyping, and develop a sense of ownership over the
      prototype...Since participants learn about the design space and
      limitations of the prototype, they are able to give specific feedback and
      input, which the interaction designer can implement."</p>
    <p>"Designing a flexible prototype in combination with supportive tools to
      be used by both interaction designers and non-designers during development
      is introduced as a way to open up the prototyping process to these users."</p>
    <p>"the prototype itself is an object of design, with its users and use
      context, which deserves further attention."</p>
    <p>"Prototypes ...become the “essential medium for information, interaction,
      integration, and collaboration” (Schrage 1996).</p>
    <p>"I describe the role of interaction design prototypes in new product
      development and relate this to discussions in the literature on prototype
      fidelity, ownership and users"</p>
    <p>"Prototypes occupy the space between fluid concepts and rigid products,
      and play an important role in the transition from the one to the other."</p>
    <p>"Prototypes can be powerful boundary objects (Carlile 2002), enabling
      team members to share ideas, communicate and discuss, but this requires
      bringing in these people at the right time (Schrage 1996)."</p>
    <p>"Showing the prototype later in the process is risky too, since it is
      often costly to make changes, and developers run the risk of defending
      design suggestion they invested in, rather than being open to suggestions
      (cf. Rettig 1994)."</p>
    <p>"It is in the making of prototypes that the prototyper runs into design
      constraints, makes design decisions, evaluates its implications and thus
      gets to know the prototype intimately. During this process, interaction
      designers engage in “thinking through prototyping” (Klemmer et al. 2006),
      which is a reflective learning process (cf. Schön 1983; Hartmann et al.
      2006). This learning is largely tacit; it is not easily transferred by
      demonstrating the prototype to others, and without this knowledge it can
      be hard to make useful suggestions, i.e. suggestions that are on the right
      level of detail and can be implemented. However, involving others in the
      making of a prototype is not as<br>
      straightforward as it may seem. Prototyping is an expert activity,
      requiring some technical knowledge, and can take a long time."</p>
    <p>"Different approaches and methods to develop prototypes have been
      described and one of the central discussions in the literature has been on
      what level of detail or fidelity an interaction design prototype is most
      appropriate in relation to the stage of the project and the type of
      feedback the designers seek to get with the prototype."</p>
    <p>"When introducing paper prototyping, Rettig (1994) describes five
      problems with high-fidelity prototypes in the context of software
      development. They “take too long to build and change” making them
      ill-suited for early development, “Reviewers and testers tend to comment
      on “fit and finish” issues” which is a type of feedback that is less
      relevant in early development, “Developers resist changes” since they
      invest a lot in the prototype and grow affectionate of it, “A prototype in
      software can set expectations that will be hard to change” meaning that
      once others, e.g. a client or user, see the prototype, they will expect it
      to continue along that path and “A single bug in a hi-fi prototype can
      bring a test to a complete halt”.</p>
    <p>"Combining the advantages of both [computer-based and paper-based]
      approaches, without the disadvantages is the ‘holy grail’ I have been
      seeking throughout my experiences as an interaction designer, both in
      education, industry and research."</p>
    <p>"Klemmer et al. pose that “[prototypes] themselves embody design ideas or
      specifications, render them concrete and, in doing so, inform the
      designer’s thinking”"</p>

    <title>Schemata, Gambits and Precedent: Some Factors in Design Expertise</title>

    <h1><a href="../papers/621bbfcaea51d81c4b09bb3bfa2f01af.pdf">Schemata,
        Gambits and Precedent: Some Factors in Design Expertise</a></h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Referenced as a major conceptual foundation by Dan Lockton regards his
      "Design with Intent" workshopping cards.&nbsp; They talk about design
      'gambits' drawing a parallel with chess players, who do not exhaustively
      or analytically approach a game, but instead their expertise relies on
      'experience' and 'recognition' of the board state. Similarly, they explore
      studies of conversation within an architectural practice, and descriptions
      of two-dimensional images shared&nbsp; between graphical designers,
      concluding they rely on a shared base of 'precedent' references. They note
      the dominance of story, e.g. within the architectural practice, and
      characterise forms of memory in use as being 'episodic' (narrative) rather
      than 'semantic' (theoretical/verbal?)</p>
    <p>This suggests a line of enquiry for me, that users may be taught the
      value-system (win/lose analogy with chess) and the gambits of programming
      through preparing their recognition of problem situations and possible
      solutions. This could mean they can act intelligently within the program
      design space, without necessarily being coders. They may recognise the
      structure of a failure condition without necessarily having to demonstrate
      it (needing a digitally programmed prototype). With sufficient priming in
      this space, it may be possible for domain-led program design discussion to
      be sustained by non-programmers.</p>
    <p>They draw upon the concept of affordance as a proposed organising
      principle for precedents, so that designers can match problem cases to
      possible stories or previous scenarios.</p>
    <p>They interestingly draw out this contrast of being "solution focused"
      (designerly?) versus "problem focused" (analytical?). Could this relate to
      hacking versus computer science - combining designerly strategies with
      code?)</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"The paper concludes that design expertise cannot be understood by
      studying actions alone but that our research needs to concentrate on
      perception and recognition and that we will have to examine conversations
      and memories as much as drawings."</p>
    <p>"to get good data on this we need to study not just the actions,
      graphical outputs and finished designs of these designers but also the
      conversations they have with each other and their clients during their
      normal working practice"</p>
    <p>"for [high level thinking] to occur in design teams the schemata and
      gambits need to be shared to the extent that they can be named and
      communicated with simple references." - suggests a kind of test for the
      success of pedagogy to teach programming gambits to participants - can they
      use them as shared references.</p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>They follow through a procurement process to try and figure out where the
      usability part happens and who has responsibility for it (supplier or
      procurer). They find that it falls between the gaps, and propose engaging
      much earlier with the 'how' and usability questions, and engaging
      professionals to do so, because the procurement staff, untrained in
      usability, found confronting usability issues hard .</p>

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"Difficulties also arose because the tools that they used were based on
      idealized models of how users worked."</p>
    <p>"Procurers, on the other hand, have relied on suppliers to create usable
      systems and have not focused explicitly on usability issues in their
      procurements (Holmlid &amp; Artman, this<br>
      volume). Unfortunately, although <em>it might seem obvious to expect that
        the system you purchase should be usable and useful this is seldom the
        case</em>. An important reason is that usability issues have not been
      dealt with consciously in organisations or projects and have been
      separated in development processes" [my italics]</p>
    <p>"another reason why usability activities are often omitted in contract
      development is that the activities do not seem to add much to what has
      already been done in the procurement, even though this work may not have
      focused on actual use at all"</p>
    <p>"the user-centred design process can be seen as divided into two stages.
      The first stage, the “what” stage, aims at defining what kind of system
      and functionality that will solve identified user needs. The second stage,
      the “how” stage, addresses how the interaction with the identified
      functionality should be designed."</p>

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"PD research began in the mid 1970’s in reaction to the ways in which
      computer-based systems were introduced in the workplace"</p>
    <p>"The pioneering work of Nygaard and his associates in the NJMF project
      (Nygaard, 1979) was the foundation upon which later PD<br>
      projects, the Swedish DEMOS project (Ehn and Sanberg, 1979) and the Danish
      DUE project (Kyng and Mathiassen, 1982), were launched. The strategy
      included a research agenda in which researchers and local trade unions
      explored the potential and actual consequences of introducing specific
      computer-based systems into the workplace (Arena A) and developed goals
      and strategies for workers and their unions to pursue in relation to
      management’s technological initiatives (Arena B)."</p>
    <p>"management’s goals and strategies often were built into the new systems
      and were reinforced by organizational distributions of power, making it
      difficult to alter the technology to fit workers’ needs and interests.
      Researchers and workers were interested in determining if it would be
      possible to design, develop, and implement technologies which took as
      their starting point the needs and interests of workers."</p>
    <p>"three basic requirements for participation outlined by Kensing (1983):
      (1) access to relevant information, (2) the possibility for taking an
      independent position on the problems, and (3) participation in decision
      making. They add two additional requirements: (4) the availability of
      appropriate participatory development methods and (5) room for alternative
      technical and/or organizational arrangements."</p>
    <p>"Of central importance is the development of meaningful and productive
      relations between those charged with technology design and those who must
      live with its consequences."</p>
    <p>"At one end of the spectrum, worker participation is limited to providing
      designers with access to workers’ skills and experiences. The workers<br>
      have little or no control over the design process or its outcome...Workers
      are asked to participate in those aspects of the project where their input
      is viewed as valuable (e.g. description of current work practices and
      testing/evaluation of technology) but left out of most technology-related
      decisions....At the other end of the spectrum...workers participate in
      negotiations over how projects are organized and what outcomes are
      desired. They take an active part in (1) the analysis of needs and
      possibilities, (2) the evaluation and selection of technology components,
      (3) the design and prototyping of new technologies, and (4) the
      organizational implementation."</p>

        Embodiment in General-Purpose Computing</a></h1>
    <h2>Authors</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>She is looking to present a model for 'screenless' [my term] interactions
      with general purpose computing, and casting around for references and
      examples which could underpin it, and figuring out what aspects would need
      to be taken account.</p>
    <p>She discusses Gibson, Norman, but also Dourish, who explores Heidegger
      present-at-hand and ready-at-hand, and moves towards an analysis of
      coupling between embodied interaction and meaning, making interaction
      effective (make things happen) though doesn't seem to turn this into
      design&nbsp; design principles.</p>
    <h2>Field of Study</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>Affordance [credited to Gibson 1977], Gulf of Execution, Gulf of
      Evaluation</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"the importance of affordance needs to be emphasized in interface design,
      as it points to what we pay attention to when interacting with an object,
      how we perceive it as possible to use. It therefore plays a key role in
      deciding what a user most likely will do when operating an interface."</p>
    <p>"The dominant interface for personal computers—the graphical user
      interface—is highly ocularcentric, where only parts of the body apparatus
      (eyes and hands) are addressed in the interface directly. As an increasing
      amount of information, life experience and human contact is channeled
      through it, the desktop computer system, becomes increasingly inadequate
      to fully represent these actions. Any prosthesis added to or used in
      conjunction with the body and any part of the sensory apparatus neglected
      will define our interaction with information. Information gathered by the
      somesthetic—the touch and proprioceptic senses—constitute a significant
      component in the way we form hypotheses about what an object is, and how
      it can be manipulated. By addressing the somesthetic senses in computer
      interfaces, we can achieve richer and more intuitive interactive
      experiences."</p>
    <p>"representation of functionality and possible user actions is key to any
      computational environment. A user interface sets the stage for interaction
      between man and machine. It represents an environment, where a user can
      perform certain tasks and hold cues to how the same user can manipulate
      this environment according to his/her needs and desires"</p>
    <p>"Coupling is a strong concept for understanding the how we can design
      meaningful relationships between man and objects. It points to the
      significance of designing objects with a conceptual identity, that equally
      encompasses the object as a thing in it itself as well as the actions it
      can assist the user in performing." [credited to Dourish 2001]</p>
    <p>"Norman looks at interfaces of specialized machines, such as the early
      video game consoles and household appliances, and attributes their success
      in the one-to-one relationship between the input device (whether a button,
      lever, pot or slider) and the action it performs. Norman claims that
      ideally “both the interface and the computer would be invisible” and that
      only “the task that would be visible, the task and the tool being used to
      accomplish the task” (217). User interfaces should be designed, based on
      an investigation and understanding of the tasks a user wants to accomplish
      with a computer."<br>

    <title>Service Blueprinting: A Practical Technique for Service Innovation</title>

    <h1><a href="../papers/723eba02381af7ba5ec8755080fa55ce.pdf">Service
        Blueprinting: A Practical Technique for Service Innovation</a></h1>
    <h2>Authors</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;Followed this thread to see if commonalities with Service Design
      (though not co-design in this case) means commentators draw on similar
      themes to that of Firmware. This is not only in terms of being overlooked,
      or considered too hard to model, but also perhaps techniques which could
      be transferred because of this parallel. Indeed I found a lot in common -
      with immateriality and temporality specifically flagged in ways which
      apply directly also to Firmware.</p>
    <h2>Field of Study</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"Service(s) are fluid, dynamic, and frequently co-produced in real time
      by customers, employees, and technology, often with few static physical
      properties. Thus, many of the invention protocols and prototype design
      techniques used for physical goods, hard technologies, and software do not
      work well for human and interactive services, or at least they demand
      significant adaptation to address service innovation challenges"</p>
    <p>"The purpose of this article is to describe one such technique—service
      blueprinting—a customer-focused approach for service innovation and
      service improvement"</p>
    <p>"One of the most distinctive characteristics of services is their process
      nature. 10 Unlike physical goods, services are dynamic, unfolding over a
      period of time through a sequence or constellation of events and steps.
      The service process can be viewed as a chain or constellation of
      activities that allow the service to function effectively."</p>
    <p>"Service blueprints allow all members of the organization to visualize an
      entire service and its underlying support processes, providing common
      ground from which critical points of customer contact, physical evidence,
      and other key functional and emotional experience clues can be
      orchestrated."</p>
    <p>"What is needed is a means of presenting the activities, relationships,
      and interdependencies of a service process in an objective and precise
      manner such that it is methodologically structured, but flexible enough to
      allow creativity to flow."</p>
    <p>"During the final service design stages, the service concept is likely to
      be refined over a series of iterations to the point at which a final,
      comprehensive blueprint can be produced. All relevant parties should be
      involved in this process, including in many cases customers or clients.
      The ultimate task is for each functional area involved in delivering the
      service to translate the final blueprint into detailed implementation
      plans to support their activities within the blueprint. Departmental
      sub-processes can be magnified, rendered in fine detail, and blueprinted
      on their own as sub-documents of the main blueprint. The main blueprint
      forms a common point of reference for all parties concerned with achieving
      a successful launch of the service. It also serves as a focal point for
      later refinements or last-minute changes."</p>
    <p>"Service blueprinting... could help solve problems preemptively; and it
      was able to identify failure points in a service operation...[It] was
      further developed to distinguish between onstage and backstage activities.
      These key components still form the basis of the technique and its most
      important feature, that of illuminating the customer’s role in the service
      process."</p>
    <p>"service blueprinting is not as complex or as formal as some business
      process modeling tools such as UML. Service blueprints are<br>
      relatively simple and their graphical representations are easy for all
      stakeholders involved – customers, managers, front-line employees – to
      learn, use, and even modify to meet a particular innovation’s
      requirements."</p>
    <p>"There are five components of a typical service blueprint...<br>
      • Customer Actions,<br>
      • Onstage/Visible Contact Employee Actions,<br>
      • Backstage/Invisible Contact Employee Actions,<br>
      • Support Processes, and<br>
      • Physical Evidence."</p>
    <p>"Customer actions are depicted chronologically across the top of the
      blueprint...they are typically laid out first so that all other activities
      can be seen as supporting the value proposition offered to or co-created
      with the customer. The next critical component is the “onstage/visible
      contact employee actions,” separated from the customer by the line of
      interaction...The next significant component of the blueprint is the
      “backstage/invisible contact employee actions,” separated from the onstage
      actions by the very important line of visibility. Everything that appears
      above the line of visibility is seen by the customer, while everything
      below it is invisible...The fourth critical component of the blueprint is
      “support processes” separated from contact employees by the internal line
      of interaction"</p>

    <h2>Authors</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;They have explored using paper prototyping and ethnography within a
      HCI course, teaching computer scientists. I like their distinction between
      a Software Designer and a Software Engineer. Resonates very strongly with
      my own view.</p>
    <p>Paper provides a nice overview of the intent and differences between
      techniques such as User-Centred Design, Human-Centered Systems,
      Participatory Design and Contextual Design. Particularly good summary of
      Ethnography.</p>
    <h2>Field of Study</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>Contextual Design, Ethnography</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"Software designers need to apply methods that provide insights into the
      user's mental model of the application's target task and to invite the
      user to be an active participant in the design process."</p>
    <p>"While the software programmer/engineer is concerned with developing
      reliable, robust, and maintainable software, the software designer is
      concerned with creating products that fit within the user's overall
      activities, enhance productivity, and produce a satisfying experience"</p>
    <p>"Left to their own devices, computer programmers take a "systems-centered
      point of view", concerned about "how the software works and what parts of
      it do what" [8, p. 217-218]."</p>
    <p>"Contextual design relies on ethnographic techniques from anthropology
      [10, 19, 15, 4, 5]. Ethnography is a method of research in which the
      researcher gathers data within a natural setting that involves a dynamic
      network o f interrelated variables. No attempt is made to control
      variables within the setting, for this could alter or destroy the
      phenomenon being studied. The purpose o f ethnographic research is to
      attempt to understand what is happening naturally in the setting, and
      through interpreting the data gathered to see what implications can be
      formed from the data."</p>
    <p>"The final product produced from an ethnographic study should be a 'thick
      description" of the situation, so that the situation appears sufficiently
      realistic, and so that others in examining the description can determine
      whether the implications drawn from the study can be applied to other
      settings."</p>
    <p>"HCI Students [after being taught Participatory Design] lamented that
      while they now understood the way design should be done, based on their
      experiences "unfortunately that is not the way it is done in the real
      world.""</p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Linked to UBC - a very interesting location in the world for paragliding
      :) </p>
    <p>They look into cognitive issues of using model-driven approach in
      software engineering for cars (firmware) drawing on interviews and using
      the metaphor of force and friction, in a way which is intended to
      transcend the specific tools used, and apply to model-driven in general.</p>
    These forces and frictions, and the form of analysis used, may transfer to
    the study of (representational) boundary objects for firmware engineering. <br>
    <br>
    Also interesting are the (multi-layered) representations inside Simulink,
    and the other representations, including formal transformation rules, and
    informal 'patches' which accrete around it.<br>
    <br>
    Deserves a proper read-through, having just cherry-picked the important
    concepts this time, especially to decide whether these 'forces and
    frictions' transfer to firmware co-design.<br>

    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"Most domain experts thus have a strong background in electrical or
      mechanical engineering, but typically no formal education in software
      engineering."</p>
    <p>"Fig. 2. Sketch of a Simulink model: from left to right we see model
      layers of increasing nesting level, starting with the entry function down
      to implementation logic." [links to layers within Service blueprinting?]</p>
    <p>"Using Brooks’s terminology, forces are indicators of innate complexity
      while frictions introduce accidental complexity"</p>
    <p>"Without the linear order of text lines, which is superimposed upon
      source code, visual programming as found in models has no linear reading
      path and can possibly stretch in all directions, left, right, top, bottom,
      and even down to the next nesting level. While modeling guidelines try to
      alleviate this by imposing a flow from top-left to bottom-right, engineers
      struggle with reading visual models as to make sure they are not missing a
      part of their work to-be-done."</p>
    <p>"While architectural complexity is well hidden from software engineers,
      they are still exposed to substantial innate complexity (contextual
      forces) and often even new accidental complexity (points of frictions in
      modeling tools). In particular, the representational abstraction of visual
      modeling languages does not seem to be as broad and rich as the
      problem-specific visual and formal languages of the domain experts."</p>
    <p>"While the MDE tools under study provide specialized code-generation
      engineers with powerful abstraction, they do not similarly empower its
      end-users, i.e., domain experts and software engineers, to express their
      own problem-specific languages and type systems."</p>

        Translating and Transforming: An Integrative Framework for Managing
        Knowledge across Boundaries</a></h1>
    <h2>Authors</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Author on knowledge transfer, boundaries, recommended by Patrick. The
      scenario I'm looking at is very much simpler than their "Beta motors"
      example - just users and firmware engineers. They emphasise the relevance
      of knowledge transfer in the early phases of product design, and firmware
      co-design is almost completely the opposite end of this - the product is
      mostly settled. Their case concerns complex interdependencies amongst
      multiple specialist groups. Core concepts are "difference and dependence."
      meaning the separation of different specialists, as well as their need to
      get along, or resolve things together. On this analysis, users and
      engineers max out both dimensions.</p>
    <p>He discusses the use of a 'clay model' (carving of a car?) as a kind of
      boundary object, or in his terms a kind of 'knowledge' which failed in
      certain ways to accommodate new conflicts and transfers between teams with
      different function in delivering a new car design. He evolves the term
      boundary object to consider "boundary processes" and "boundary
      infrastructure"</p>
    <h2>Field of Study</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>Difference and Dependence, Syntactic Boundaries, Semantic Boundaries,
      Pragmatic Boundaries, Competency Traps [credited to Barnett and Hansen,
      1996], communities of practice [credited to Wenger], creative abrasion
      [credited to Leonard-Barton 1995], path-dependent knowledge, boundary
      process</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    "The framework describes three progressively complex types of boundaries—
    syntactic, semantic and pragmatic—each managed by a different
    process—transfer, translation and transformation."
    <p>"Each increasingly complex boundary requires a more complex process to
      facilitate communication and innovation across specialized forms of
      knowledge."</p>
    <p>"From a knowledge perspective, differences at a boundary arise from
      variation in the type of skills and backgrounds or amount of experience
      between individuals or groups."</p>
    <p>"When a shared syntax or language sufficiently specifies the differences
      and dependencies at the boundary the boundary is “unproblematic;” the
      primary concern becomes “processing” or transferring knowledge through
      this shared syntax."</p>
    <p>"successful movements of knowledge occur when the parties are specialized
      in the same type of activity, so the primary difference is only that the
      sender is experienced in the best practice and the receiver is not."</p>
    <p>"The value of a syntactical approach to managing knowledge across a
      boundary is realized when a shared and stable syntax/language exists.
      Based on this knowledge can be efficiently transferred at the boundary.
      Such a shared and stable syntax/language is constructed from previous
      efforts at a boundary to address the critical differences and dependencies
      between the two groups—and once established only the costs of transferring
      knowledge are faced at the boundary."</p>
    "Under these conditions a shared and sufficient syntax that had been used in
    the past is no longer able to address the novel differences and dependencies
    which arise. So, while a shared syntax is necessary, it is not always
    sufficient to address all conditions at a boundary."<br>
    <br>
    "A semantic approach to crossing a boundary recognizes that problems of
    interpretation exist because the contexts in which people develop their
    knowledge are different or as novelty increases, interpretive or semantic
    differences as to what a word, measurement or outcome means arise at a
    boundary."<br>
    <br>
    "Frequently highlighted in the community of practice literature is the role
    of “stories” as an effective means of sharing knowledge and meaning (Wenger,
    1998). In Orr’s (1996) study of Xerox repairman, “war stories” proved an
    effective tool in sharing knowledge about the complex technical and social
    situations that arise when repairing a copier."<br>
    <br>
    "When moving knowledge across [a] boundary often the problem is one of
    different interests, not just different meanings that need to be
    reconciled."<br>
    <br>
    "To understand the problematic nature of knowledge, it must be understood as
    localized, embedded and invested in the tasks, methods and outcomes of a
    specific practice (i.e., knowledge-in-practice). Knowledge is costly to
    develop (i.e., education, training, experience) and to change, so it should
    be seen as “at stake” for the individuals in a given practice (Bourdieu and
    Wacquant, 1992). This helps us see more clearly why accommodating the
    knowledge of another group is not a neutral or costless effort. The cost for
    any group dealing with increasing novelty at a boundary is not just the cost
    of learning about what is new. It is also the costs of adjusting or
    transforming their “current” ways of doing things to accommodate the
    knowledge developed by another group to collaborate at a boundary."<br>
    <br>
    "a complex boundary process has to be developed where current and more novel
    forms of knowledge can be represented, learned about, and then jointly
    transformed"<br>
    <br>
    "the clay model’s representational capacity to support such a pragmatic
    process was undermined as the conditions at the boundary became increasingly
    novel during the 80’s and early 90’s The clay model could no longer
    represent the differences and dependencies that were relevant across the
    four groups involved as it did not provide a means for them to collectively
    make trade-offs and transform their current knowledge."<br>
    <br>
    "I have identified three following characteristics...that we might expect to
    see in an effective boundary process: establishes a shared language to
    represent knowledge; provides a concrete means of specifying differences and
    dependencies; and facilitates a method in which individuals can jointly
    transform the knowledge used"<br>
    <br>
    "A climate control engineer summed this up nicely, when he said, “we
    disagree sooner and know what we are disagreeing about more productively
    when we have a shared basis to compare our requirements.”<br>
    <br>
    "The first characteristic required to effectively manage knowledge across a
    pragmatic boundary is the development of some shared language or syntax to
    represent knowledge at the boundary...The second characteristic required to
    manage knowledge across a pragmatic boundary is that the individuals
    involved need the ability to represent their preferences to others...The
    third characteristic required to manage knowledge across a pragmatic
    boundary is that the process or tool can be used to alter or transform the
    knowledge being used at the boundary."<br>
    <br>
    "the ability and willingness of individuals to change their knowledge or
    position only emerges when a process of identifying how it negatively
    impacts others is established"<br>
    <br>
    "The gap at many boundaries cannot be resolved with one try, but requires an
    iterative process of closing the gap—experimenting and shaping alternatives
    and solutions overtime....<br>

    <p>"One of the first to return to the notion was Kathryn Henderson in an
      anthropology of the design activity (Henderson, 1991, 1998a). She is
      particularly interested in visual representations – drawings and diagrams
      – produced to organise discussions and move collective work forward. These
      are elements which facilitate the distributed cognitive process because
      they facilitate the crossover between interpretations held by the
      different professional groups involved in the design of a turbine. In her
      work (Henderson, 1998b), she explores the impact of computer-assisted
      design tools on visual design culture."</p>

    <p>A PUM (programmable user model) is a boundary object for describing the
      behaviour (and state of mind) of a user in order to permit more precise
      specification of usability proposals or concerns.</p>
    <p>Contrasts with the model advocated by Alan Dix in his preamble to "Formal
      Methods for Interactive Systems" where he advocates modelling the system
      from the point of view of the user. This is very strongly about modelling
      the user.</p>

    </p>
    <h2>Field of Study</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>PUM (Programmable User Model)</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Related: GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods and Selection rules Card et al),
      KLM (Keystroke Level Modelling) and Methods-Time Measurement also linked
      to this - a quality metric not unlike Thimbleby's 'time to read manual' as
      a quantitative metric.</p>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"A Programmable User Model (PUM) is a psychologically constrained
      architecture which an interface designer is invited to program to simulate
      a<br>
      user performing a range of tasks with a proposed interface. It provides a
      novel way of conveying psychological considerations to the designer, by<br>
      involving the designer in the process of making predictions of usability."</p>
    <p>"The Human Factors advisor might reply "It's a confusing design, people
      won't be able to use it". the designer will reject the judgement (because
      it is<br>
      simply the advisor's word against the designer's) and will find it
      genuinely unhelpful (because of the lack of specific diagnosis and
      guidance)"</p>
    <p>"guidelines would indicate something like: "Users can retain at most four
      items of changing information; design the interface so that they never
      need to store more...suppose... that we present the designer with a
      programmable architecture that has only four slots (say) for dynamic
      information ...Then the designer has to program the PUM respecting the
      constraint, or else the model will make errors when it runs."</p>
    <p>"Users deciding on their next action may need to gather and weigh
      evidence from a number of different sources and lines of reasoning, such
      as: previous experience with the system; remembered instructions for
      performing the current task; analogies from other tasks or everyday
      behaviour;<br>
      information on or derivable from the screen; examples in a manual; and so
      on."</p>

    <p>"The overall motivation for GOMS and other HCI cognitive modeling efforts
      is to provide engineering models of human performance. In the ideal, such
      models produce a priori quantitative predictions of performance at an
      earlier stage in the development process than prototyping and user

    <p>"[Mumford] believed that neither change nor management are ends in
      themselves. Management needs to consider ethical<br>
      and social issues that are intrinsically linked to all social change. In
      order to be able to manage change in an acceptable<br>
      manner, participation of those who are affected by it should be
      encouraged. Participation in decision making, in particular<br>
      regarding the design and use of technology, should lead to greater
      employee satisfaction and higher productivity, and<br>
      better use of local knowledge, thereby furthering employers' goals."</p>
    <p>"Socio-technical systems design provides a new worldview of what
      constitutes quality of working life and humanism at<br>
      work. It facilitates organizational innovation by recommending the removal
      of many elite groups and substituting flatter<br>
      hierarchies, multiskilling and group decision-taking. It wants to replace
      tight controls, bureaucracy and stress with an<br>
      organization and technology that enhances human freedom, democracy and
      creativity" (credited to Mumford, 2003 p. 262).</p>
    <p>"the critical intention is normative in that it aims to change the way we
      act. This normative intention cannot result from mere observation of the
      world. Critical research, therefore, must implicitly contain a normative
      premise that is based on some sort of ethical foundation."</p>

        construction of fictional space in participatory design practice<br>
      </a></h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>They look at the design of museum spaces and experiences as a PD process,
      then step back to analyse the results to understand the 'fictional spaces'
      which exist within creative workshops, as people imagine things which
      don't yet exist, and step away from the confines of reality.</p>
    <p>Emphasis on the space metaphor, and the problem transformations which
      designers do to recast these 'spaces' conceptually. They relate this to
      literary fictions, and measures of realism which are used in that parallel
      domain.</p>
    <p>In their case studies, they use 'obstructions' in a design brief as props
      to "mandate particular forms of imagining". However, they use these
      examples to pursue a more philosophical examination of fiction, as
      suggested by...</p>
    <p>"the [fictional space] perspective enables reflection on three aspects of
      design inquiries. First, it provides concepts for reflecting on how design
      inquiries are staged in terms of the props chosen and how these are
      intended to promote particular avenues for participants to pursue. Second,
      the perspective provides concepts for reflection in action as design
      inquiries unfold by highlighting the dynamic processes in which fictional
      truths are created and negotiated among participants. Third, the
      perspective provides means for reflecting on the outcomes of design
      inquiries in terms of understanding how participants create new
      constellations by conflating elements from existing practices with novel
      conceptions."</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"With inspiration from literary theory, it is argued that the production
      of fictional space may be understood in terms of participants practicing
      games of make-believe mediated by props."</p>
    <p>"Common to these approaches and to PD in general is an emphasis on
      designing with users as a situated phenomenon; a practice that takes place
      in particular settings, with particular people, and under particular
      circumstances and that these fundamentally shape what is envisioned and
      designed in the cooperation between designers and users" - relates to
      workshopping with Paraglider pilots in Manteigas.</p>
    <p>"what is given from the outset, however vague or ill-defined, is changed
      through the process. Design is thus always design of something given, but
      what that given is depends on what is designed. From a rational point of
      view, this state of affairs seems at best circular, at worst logically
      paradoxical." - discusses what is interesting about "design briefing" and
      the renegotiation of the problem itself (probably from within an assumed
      value system underlying the original request).</p>
    <p>"props may serve to coordinate imagination among participants. What is
      imagined and how the fictional space develops has both aspects of people
      enacting what is afforded by the materials provided (props) and people
      bringing to the table novel insights or perhaps changing the very
      structure of the fictional truths that make up the fictional space. "</p>

    <p>Greenbaum and Kyng (1991) again credited for introducing participatory
      design.</p>
    <p>Ehn (1988) conceptualising PD "as a mutual learning process where
      designers step into the world of use and users learn about the
      opportunities offered by technology" and for his "assertion that design is
      always caught in the tension between tradition and transcendence; between
      what already exists and what could exist in the future" and that the
      "effect of alienation/distancing) may serve to highlight untried
      possibilities as it ‘re-casts’ what is already known in a new light"</p>
    <p>"Donald Schon [(1987)] showed how design develops as fluctuations between
      problem setting and problem solving...an alternative to Herbert Simon’s
      (1969) idea of design as a ‘science of the artificial’</p>
    <p>Rittel and Weber (1973) wicked problems paper is credited.</p>
    <p>Malmgren (1985) delivers a key thrust to their analysis - describing
      fictional worlds in novels according to alienation 'distance' or angle of
      departure. Malmgren's "point, that fictional spaces most often draw on
      non-fictional elements and that they in fact intersect. Fictional spaces
      may be to a large extent autonomous, but they maintain links to
      non-fiction."</p>
    <p>Walton (1990) outlines three roles props can have for creative thought,
      as prompts of creativity, as actual objects of the creative input or as a
      means to deliver a fictional truth</p>
    <p>Muller (2003) "has provided a comprehensive account of the parameters,
      practices<br>
      and props used in terms of creating hybridity in PD work...the in-between
      regions that share attributes of both users’ and designers’ space leading
      to new interpretations and ideas" - this is a re-definition of boundary
      objects isn't it?</p>

      whether the metaphor of tiling or imbrication is better - stuck together

      and benefits from this distinction.</p>

    <p>imbrication</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"re-focusing attention on the materiality of the tools with which people
      work—is especially important if one wishes to take a design orientation to
      organizational analysis. By design orientation we mean conducting research
      that not only allows us to describe organizational processes, but to
      generate insights about how to improve them"</p>
    <p>"the metaphor of imbrication becomes a useful alternative to the metaphor
      of entanglement (Leonardi 2011). The verb “to imber” derives from a kind
      of Greek and Roman tile, known as imbrex (from imber, “rain”), used in
      combination with other kind of tile called “tegula”. Imbrices were laid
      out so that one slightly overlapped the next one, in the same way as the
      scales of a fish, thereby channeling the rain over the tegulae, and off
      the roof. In the same way as imbrices and tegulae differ in their
      constituent make-up, so too do social and material agencies. “Though both
      [are] capabilities for action, [they] differ phenomenologically with
      respect to intention. Thus, like the tegula and the imbrex, they have
      distinct contours and through their imbrication they come to form an
      integrated organizational structure” (Leonardi 2011, p. 37)."</p>

    <p>"The focus on technologies-in-practice also allows an examination of the
      extent to which users realize designers' intentions for a technology....It
      has long been recognized that technologies are often not used as designed
      or intended (Bijker 1995, von Hippel 1988), but generating an adequate
      understanding of how, where, and why the slippage between design and use
      occurs in practice has been difficult. By distinguishing between
      technologies as artifacts and technologies-in-practice, we have a way to
      explore and explain this process."</p>
    <p>"The first type of enactment may be characterized in terms of <strong><em>inertia</em></strong>,
      where users choose to use technology to retain their existing way of doing
      things...The second type of enactment may be characterized in terms of <strong><em>application</em></strong>,
      where people choose to use the new technology to augment or refine their
      existing ways of doing things...The third type of enactment may be
      characterized in terms of<em><strong> change</strong></em>, where people
      choose to use the new technology to substantially alter their existing way
      of doing things"</p>
    <p>"future research could benefit from attending more carefully to the
      meanings and emotional attachments that users develop for the technologies
      they use."</p>
    <p>"By not examining or understanding what actually happens during use of
      technology, researchers and managers miss the crucial point, that it is
      whether and how people interact with technology in their day-to-day
      activities-not the mere presence of the technology on the desktop or
      factory floor-that influences performance outcomes and consequences."</p>
    <p>"These structures of technology use (technologies-in-practice) are not
      fixed or given, but constituted and reconstituted through the<br>
      everyday, situated practices of particular users using particular
      technologies in particular circumstances. By attending to such ongoing
      (re)constitution, a practice lens entails the examination of emergence,
      improvisation, and change over time as people reconfigure their
      technologies or alter their habits of use, and thereby enact different
      technologies-in-practice."</p>

    <p>"To find the most productive use of a new technology, avoiding all
      unexpectedly negative side-effects, you should systematically study all
      possible options and all their direct and indirect consequences. Because
      of bounded rationality, however, this is obviously impossible. Instead,
      improvements are typically made by trial-and-error, where first the most
      obvious applications are tried out, and users slowly become aware of their
      positive and negative effects. On the basis of that experience, they learn
      how to avoid clearly unproductive applications. They then try out minor
      variations or<br>
      improvements on the apparent “best practices”, and perhaps carry out a few
      more daring experiments that may open wholly new domains of application.
      They thus gradually discover more productive ways to use this same
      technology, ending up with initially unimagined uses."</p>

    <p>&nbsp;Tesler worked at Xerox Parc credited for early work on thinking
      about appropriate implementations of functions, e.g. avoiding complex
      modes [his numberplate is NOMODES]. He went on to lead some important work
      at Apple</p>
    <h2>Field of Study</h2>
    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"Findings from my early studies at Xerox PARC showed that modes were very
      difficult for people to deal with.<br>
      People were always getting into the wrong mode and did not know how to get
      back out."</p>
    <p>"even an idea that seems elegant and that satisfies some principle is not
      necessarily going to succeed. The only way to find out is to test it."</p>
    <p>"To make the tests of maximum benefit to the<br>
      designers, there are certain rules we try to<br>
      follow: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Don't offer help too soon;</li>
      <li>Welcome suggestions and reactions;</li>
      <li>Observe but don't pressure"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>"Even if the subject makes an obvious statement, a trivial remark, or
      suggests something tha% is impossible to do on a computer, it is important
      to welcome his reactions and discuss them as an equal."</p>
    <p>"We start out asking open questions. "Well, what do you think?" or "What
      was hard; what was easy?" Later we pose more direct questions like "The<br>
      time you made that certain error, what were you thinking?" or "What do you
      think is a better term for this concept?" Usually in the open-question
      stage we get some really good responses that are unexpected. The directed
      questions address more specific issues."</p>
    <p>"Occasionally, some user's unique quirk may be worth memtioning~ but what
      is of most concern is what most or all users experienced."</p>
    <p>"Some people think they can design friendly software just by being clever
      or by reading papers on principles of user interface design.</p>

    <p>Norman argues that all significant innovations have taken place driven by
      technology, and not delivered by the nuances of user-driven activities or
      design-research "Technology First, Needs Last".&nbsp;</p>
    <p>His observation that design research should focus more on incremental

    <p></p>
    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"Most innovations are small, relatively simple, and fit comfortably into
      the established rhythm and competencies of the existing product-delivery<br>
      cycle. Moreover, it is these small, incremental improvements that are best
      informed by design research."</p>
    <p>"Design research encompasses many activities, but when deployed to
      develop and enhance commercial products or services it consists of studies
      aiming to understand the activities, desires, and needs of the people for
      whom a product or service is designed."</p>
    <p>"The least interesting innovations to the university and company research
      community are the small, slow enhancements that gradually lower costs
      while improving performance. But in fact, not only is this where most
      product enhancement takes place, but it is also where the research
      community can add the most value. This is where ethnographic observation
      can be powerful, uncovering the difficulties people have in everyday use,
      the workarounds and hacks they invent that can suggest product
      modifications. This allows existing products to be modified at low cost,
      low risk, while making them ever more attractive, ever more valuable to
      the customer base."</p>

    <p>Talk about stimulating the creativity of users, and allowing them to

      papers which discuss the concrete projects they did. Mostly this paper is
      about Wittgenstein and 'language games' and the parallel in terms of forms

      containing both designers and users. </p>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"The view that genuine user participation can be accomplished as a
      quick-and-dirty method, often leads to the participants being used merely
      as informants. Thereby the potential for innovation and creativity of the
      users [8], and their potential to challenge the assumptions and design
      ideas, stays untapped."</p>
    <p>"On one hand we have the language-game of the designers, involving
      concepts from the field<br>
      of design. On the other hand we have the language-game of the users and
      stakeholders which is grounded in their work-practice and involving
      concepts from their work domain. The question of communication between
      these two distinct practices is not a trivial one. Therefore organizing a
      way for designers and users to develop a common language becomes paramount
      for a successful design process." [discussing Ehn "Work oriented design of
      computer artefacts"]</p>
    <p>"it is important to attend to how these games<br>

    <p>"The field of interaction design deals with the development and use of
      interactive products, systems and services. It is an interventionist
      discipline in that it aims at transforming the current state of events
      through the introduction of something novel. Some interaction design
      projects radically rethink and transform the situation, whereas others
      incrementally develop existing systems and practices; however, innovation
      and creativity play a crucial role in most interaction design projects due
      to this transformative agenda."</p>

        pictures mean? Guidelines for experimental evaluation of representation
        fidelity in diagrammatical conceptual modeling techniques</a></h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Lit review, covering experimental materials supporting 'conceptual
      modeling' in systems analysis and design, substantiated by 'meaningful
      tests of domain semantics' - "research aimed at empirically evaluating ...
      diagrammatic notations... to convey semantics of a real world domain".
      They contrast 'read' tasks and 'write' tasks in experiments, and focus on
      'read' tasks. They proceed to analyse prior experiments within a model of
      evidential quality and procedural legitimacy which they outline at the
      beginning of the paper. </p>
    <p>They focus on formal validity questions, e.g. controlled variables in
      subject selection, choice of lab versus ex-lab. Four contrasting
      experimental design aspects are highlighted, independent variables, <strong><em>dependent
          measures, participants and procedures</em></strong>.</p>
    <p>Recommend 'informational equivalence' so that the semantic delivery of
      different representations. They see dependent measures, such as a test of
      competence which combines knowledge represented with prior knowledge, to
      be problematic. They point out that Subject Matter Experts must not be
      used! (though they accept this undermines external validity) [a
      methodological challenge for CDPF? Does it need a modelling formalism for
      firmware?]. They feel that 'scripts' or representations should not be
      removed during assessment, as this focuses more on learning than on
      content transmitted, and is more externally valid. They propose an
      approach to obfuscate details from information, making them 'semantically
      void' such that prior knowledge cannot be used.</p>

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"The first computer was developed by Charles Babbage. It cost more than a
      locomotive and did not work properly. Even though everyone tells us that
      computers are now "more powerful," the basic story does not seem to have
      changed."</p>
    <p>"It is well known that designers often design for themselves unless they
      have been trained to realize that people are diverse, and that users are
      unlikely to be like them. In computing, the design problem is exacerbated
      because designers, who are self-selected to be computer competent, are
      typically many times better at using computers than everyone else. In
      contrast, in any other common area of design--say, designing chairs--the
      designers would be unlikely to have such special and distinctive skills
      that marked them out as so different from everyone else. Who is so good
      at, say, sitting that they might underestimate how hard everyone else
      finds using chairs?"</p>

    <p>Linked to a company (see Chris Bull - interviewed for them) which

    <p>Their phrases about creating a domain schema and then producing domain
      code, which maps to target code sounds an awful lot like BT Rules, and the
      intentional tree is almost identical.</p>
    <p>They discuss allowing ambiguity within domain representations, and

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"domain experts can work in parallel with programmers in their respective
      areas of expertise; and the repeated intermingling can be automated"</p>
    <p>"Because programs are the only precise (i.e. machine processable)
      artifacts that record the programmers’ work, any change (whether
      maintenance or extension) has to be done to the program, which is encoded
      in a way that does not clearly express the problem that was to be solved."</p>
    <p>"The goal of software is to implement a solution to a problem that is
      defined by human intent alone. Some people have expertise in the problem
      domain - they are domain experts. Some people have expertise in software
      creation – they are programmers. Together they create software, perhaps
      with some people in both roles."</p>
    <p>"For the creation of any software, two kinds of contributions need to be
      combined even though they are not at all similar: those of the domain
      providing the problem statement and those of software engineering
      providing the implementation. They need to be woven together to form the
      program."</p>
    <p>"The direct development workflow in use today (Figure 1) is the
      following: The domain expert communicates the problemstatement to the
      programmer. This is done in forms that can not be automatically
      transformed into code, such as specs, use cases, stories, and sketches.
      The programmer then weaves these intentions together with software
      engineering knowledge and implementation decisions and creates the source
      code that can run on a computer."</p>
    <p>"The domain expert need not make a decision whether the domain concept is
      an object, a quality, an action, a goal, or anything else. The need is
      just to establish an identity for it, whatever it may be, and that can be
      accomplished always in the same way—by a def in the schema."</p>

        AS CONTROL: A FIELD STUDY OF COMPUTER GAME DESIGN</a></h1>
    <h2>Authors</h2>
    <p>Patrick Stacey</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Patrick uses the example of a case-study around a computer game design
      firm. Initially comments on the variety of established software
      development methodologies and their explicit or unspoken failings, around
      the centrality of planning. He goes on to examine the practice of software
      development as exercised by the case study firm in which improvisation
      could be said to be central, although this doesn't mean 'out of control'
      on Giddens definition (introduced page 17). He uses a theory of the human
      activity which separates aspects of Signification, Domination and
      Legitimation, in which Communication, Power and Sanction act through
      Interpretive Schemes, Resources and Rules respectively (three parallel
      aspects) - see diagram on Page 6. I really like the contrast between Flux
      and Sedimentation as it maps well to design theory, in which many alternatives
      are generated by some processes, and they are culled in others.</p>
    <h2>Field of Study</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>Structuration Theory, Flux and Sedimentation</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"There are many formal approaches that have been proposed for controlling
      software projects...the Waterfall Model (Royce, 1970) ...breaks the IS
      development process down into discrete stages such as feasibility study,
      systems investigation, and implementation (Avison and Fitzgerald, 1995).
      There are a number of similar structured systems development methods such
      as Structured Systems Analysis and Design Methodology (SSADM) (Fitzgerald,
      1996) and even some forms of agile development like XP (Beck, 1999). The
      typical stages in the<br>
      development lifecycle occur in a linear sequential manner with a provision
      for feedback loops between the stages (Boehm, 1988)."</p>
    <p>"process models and other innovations such as high-level languages like
      object-oriented, have not improved the ability to control the software
      development process (Pressman, 1987); they were not ‘silver bullets’
      (Brooks, 1995)."</p>
    <p>"Therefore, there is the suggestion of letting-go in order to control
      when developers are seen to be capable, that they can deal with the<br>
      complexity of the situation as it emerges (Bach, 1995). This is consonant
      with the amethodical view of software development, which promotes
      embracing complexity and ambiguity. Unlike metric-driven process
      improvement, amethodical development emphasizes the different voices and
      interests of the developers, as well as negotiation that lead to
      compromise solutions (Truex et al, 2000:p.71)." [this is critical also to
      the dynamic of co-design and the general discourse around Boundary
      processes]</p>
    <p>"normative methodical software development approaches are employed as a
      social defense so as to “avoid the risks of real engagement with each
      other and with the task at hand. They turn away from the exigencies of
      work and take refuge in a surreal world.” [credited to Wastell]</p>
    <p>"Improvisation therefore carries the hallmarks of control in its
      potential to bring about order from chaos (e.g.Highsmith, 2002; Ciborra
      1999).Yet it is largely regarded as something distinct from control and a
      concept that requires further research (Brown and Eisenhardt, 1995). This
      is not surprising as control usually infers planning, whereas
      improvisation does not usually involve this." [related to software
      requirements capture vs. co-design?]</p>
    <p>"I then used structuration theory (Giddens 1984) as a theoretical lens
      (Orlikowski, 2000) to guide the analysis and interpret the data."</p>
    <p>"if they did not need a feature then it was not put it in, unless there
      was time left over for such ‘bells and whistles’. Identifying what was a
      feature and what was a bell or a whistle was constantly being decided
      on-the-fly."</p>
    <p>"Despite the constant communication between client and QGS in the form of
      reports and art samples there was still a lack of shared understanding.
      They seemed to be talking past each other, not clarifying meanings but
      making assumptions. It was only when a playable prototype was presented to
      the client that an awareness of acommunication breakdown emerged."</p>
    <p>"I now draw on the three associated dimensions and related elements of
      Giddens’ Structuration theory as a lens by which to interpret the themes
      of communication, power, and legitimation. I relate to communication to
      efforts to understand project details such as requirements and design,
      power relates to improvisation, and legitimation relates to norms of
      software development."</p>
    <p>"Legitimation could therefore lead to non-routine actions. Given the
      designs were construed as being ambiguous for instance, this provoked a
      stream of non-routine improvised activities in order to fill the
      ‘interpretive holes’ in the design in-use. The communication process
      therefore had the potential to significantly flex the game development
      practices. Indeed, play-testing was a practice that enabled the
      clarification of the meanings of the design in-use. Therefore, while
      play-testing constituted a non-routine and improvised activity, its
      repetition simultaneously contributed to the sedimentation of the design
      in-use and thereby also the process as a whole"</p>
    <p>"The communication process involved intense and ingenious efforts to make
      sense of equivocal designs in-use. To exercise their power over or
      improvise around ambiguity, the actors engaged in an intense interplay
      between (re)interpretation and play-testing. Play-testing was the act by
      which the actors performed a game prototype, i.e. a manifestation or
      “build” of a design in-use. Sometimes this occurred as a distinct phase in
      the innovation process, or through the use of a design tool. The play-test
      performance contributed to efforts to make sense of designs in-use,
      stimulating interpretation and reflection"</p>
    <p>"Through ongoing design improvisation, so a collective sense of designs
      in-use emerged, which contributed to design sedimentation and control. It
      may be imagined then that design improvisation was like a vortex or spiral
      that inched ever closer towards sedimentation,"</p>
    <p>"The implication here is that where the requirements and design have a
      strong aesthetic component, improvisation may be a more salient process
      control strategy."</p>

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"Unfortunately, due to ridiculous historical circumstances, computers
      have been made a mystery to most of the world. And this situation does not
      seem to be improving. You hear more and more about computers, but to most
      people it’s just one big blur. The people who know about computers often
      seem unwilling to explain things or answer your questions. Stereotyped
      notions develop about computers operating in fixed ways—and so confusion
      increases. The chasm between laymen and computer people widens fast and
      dangerously. This book is a measure of desperation, so serious and abysmal
      is the public sense of confusion and ignorance. Anything with buttons or
      lights can be palmed off on the laymen as a computer. There are so many
      different things, and their differences are so important; yet to the lay
      public they are lumped together as “computer stuff,” indistinct and beyond
      understanding or criticism. It’s as if people couldn’t tell apart camera
      from exposure meter or tripod, or car from truck or tollbooth."</p>
    <p>"the use of computers is dominated by a priesthood, people who spatter
      you with unintelligible answers and seem unwilling to give you straight
      ones"</p>
    <p>"great concern and consideration has always gone into calculating the
      “correct” teaching sequence for each “subject.” In recent years radical
      new teaching sequences have been introduced for teaching various subjects,
      including mathematics and physics. But such efforts appear to have been
      misinformed by the idea of supplanting the “wrong” teaching sequence with
      the “right” teaching sequence, one which is “validated.”...this all
      ignores a simple fact: all are arbitrary. Instructional sequences aren’t
      needed at all if the people are motivated and the materials are clear and
      available... Prearranged sequences become unnecessary if the student can
      see what he has yet to learn, then pursue it."</p>
    <p>"Until now, the mechanical properties of external objects determined what
      they were to us and how we used them. But henceforth this is arbitrary. <br>
      The recognition of that arbitrariness, and reconsideration among broader
      and more general alternatives, awaits us."</p>
    <p>"The human mind being as supple as it is, anything whatever can be used
      to control systems. The problem is having it be a comprehensible whole. As
      already remarked, our ability mentally to unify things is extraordinary.
      That we somehow tie together clutch, gear, accelerator and brake into a
      comprehensible control structure to make cars go and stop should amaze and
      instruct. Engineers and “human factors” people speak as though there were
      some kind of scientific or determinate way to design control systems.
      Piffle. We choose a set of controls, much like an artist’s Palette, on the
      basis of general appropriateness; and <em><strong>then try best and most
          artistically to fit them to what needs doing</strong></em> [my
      italics]. The result must be conceptually clear and retroactively
      “obvious”—simply because clarity is the simplest way to keep the user from
      making mistakes. Clear and simple systems are easier to learn, harder to
      forget, less likely to be screwed up by the user, and thus are more
      economical—getting more done for the resources put in."</p>
    <p>"Careless and horrible designs are not all fictitious. One egregious
      example also indicates the low level of design currently going into some
      responding systems: computer people have designed CRT writing systems for
      newspapers which actually have a “kill” button on the console, by which
      authors would accidentally kill their stories. In a recent magazine
      article it was explained that the eventual solution was to change the
      program so that to kill the story you had to hit the “kill” button twice.
      To me this seems like a beautiful example of what happens when you let
      insulated technical people design the system for you: a “kill” button on
      the keyboard is about as intelligent as installing knives on the dashboard
      of a car, pointing at the passenger."</p>
    <p>"When computer programmers or other technical people design particular
      systems without thinking more generally, things are not<br>
      likely to be either simple or combinable. What may result are intricate
      user-level controls for one particular function, controls that are
      differently used for another particular function, making the two functions
      not combinable."</p>
    <p>"any system of controls can gradually come through use to have a
      psychological organization, even spuriously. The trap is that we so easily<br>
      lose sight of arbitrariness and even stupidity of design, and live with it
      when it could be so much better, because of this psychological melding."</p>
    <p>"The fantic structure of anything, then, consists of its noticeable
      parts, interconnections, contents and effects. I claim that it is the
      fantic unity—the conceptual and presentational clarity of these
      things—that makes fantic systems—presentational systems and material—clear
      and helpful, or not."</p>
    <p>"The branching computer screen, together with the selfsame computer’s
      ability to turn anything else on and off as selected by the user, and to
      fetch up information, yields a realm of option in the design of media and
      environment that has never existed before."</p>
    <p>"interior computer technicalities have to be SUBSERVIENT, and the
      programmers cannot be allowed to dictate how it is to behave on the basis
      of the under level structures that are convenient to them. Quite the
      contrary: from the fullest consideration of the richest upper-level
      structures we want, we the users-to-be must dictate what lower-level
      structures are to be prepared within"</p>

    <p>"It is useful, by way of summary, to distinguish four reasons why it is
      difficult to create alternatives to the standard methods of AI. First,
      it is difficult to become aware of the full range of assumptions
      underneath
      existing practices, from technical methods to genre conventions to
      metaphors.
      Second, having formulated an alternative intuition, it is difficult to
      reduce
      that intuition to a novel technical method -- a new type of artifact, or a
      new way of building artifacts. Third, having invented a new technical
      method,
      it is difficult to prevent that method from being construed as "nothing
      new"
      within the elastic boundaries of existing technical schemata. Fourth,
      having
      coupled a new technical method with a new way of talking about the
      phenomena,
      it is difficult to apply the method to any real cases without inventing a
      lot
      of additional methods as well, since any worthwhile system will require
      the
      application of several interlocking methods, and use of the existing
      methods
      may distort the novel method back toward the traditional mechanisms and
      the
      traditional ways of talking about them. This litany of obstacles does not
      make critical technical practice impossible; it simply defines the terrain
      upon which such a practice must work."</p>

    <p>"Broadly, functional requirements define what a system is supposed to <i>do</i>
      whereas non-functional requirements define how a system is supposed to <i>be</i>.
      Functional requirements are usually in the form of "system shall do
      &lt;requirement&gt;", while non-functional requirements are "system shall
      be &lt;requirement&gt;".</p>
    <p>Non-functional requirements are often called <b>qualities</b> of a
      system. Other terms for non-functional requirements are "constraints",
      "quality attributes", "quality goals", "quality of service requirements"
      and "non-behavioral requirements".<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
      Informally these are sometimes called the "ilities", from attributes like
      stability and portability. Qualities, that is non-functional requirements,
      can be divided into two main categories:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Execution qualities, such as security and usability, which are
        observable at run time.</li>
      <li>Evolution qualities, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testability"
          title="Software testability">testability</a>, maintainability,
        extensibility and scalability, which are embodied in the static
        structure of the software system.<sup id="cite_ref-Wiegers03_2-0" class="reference"><a
