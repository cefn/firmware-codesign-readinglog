  <h1>Total Design: Integrated Methods for Successful Product Engineering - Stuart Pugh</h1>

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>Explores the notion of total design - practiced in the real world, as opposed to partial design - the normal way people encounter design when they are being taught it. The book rests on the notion that without specific interventions, people's partial design training will lead to problematic design outcomes. The book presents a very commercially-oriented model of design, with a strong emphasis on 'engineering' through to sales. It has an unreconstructed view of information flow forward in the product design process, (though this may be a result of an acknowledged view of the product design in hindsight). It uses concrete examples of 'total design' such as&#160; a lifting truck, a wind tunnel, surgical robotics. The 'waterfall' forward design approach is illustrated well by the conceptual diagrams (e.g. Figure 2.2 p 32 - outlines a set of sources proceeding to a formal 'product design specification', figure 2.9 p43 shows information flow from specification to sales, but not back again). A set of formal analysis approaches are proposed; <em><strong>Parametric analysis</strong></em> - a way in which product design spaces can be plotted parametrically to identify opportunities or outliers with respect to existing competitors. <em><strong>Needs analysis</strong></em> is about gathering evidence of customer need. <em><strong>Matrix analysis</strong></em> is a tickbox representation of competitors' products' features.</p>

  <p>In summary 'total design' adds up to not-getting-it-wrong and doesn't seem to have another definition, apart from perhaps taking the series of proposed approaches by Pugh and simply executing all of them in sequence.</p>

  <h2>Concepts</h2>

  <h2>Quotations</h2>

  <p>"misdirected engineering rigour will <em><strong>always</strong></em> gie rise to bad total design. This implies that design teams should always include non-engineers....Participants should be able to see how their differing partial design contributions fit into the whole scene. This is not a desirable objective; it is considered to be essential."</p>

  <p>"an analysis of any existing product will reveal that the main design flow is from market (user need) to sales...this activity will be referred to as the 'design core'.&#160;</p>

  <p>"Needs analysis is concerned with establishing the true needs of the customer, the 'voice of the customer'. This can be obtained by extensive examination of the views and reports of representative bodies, market data publications, (buying habits), reports giving official opinions and reactions to products in use and also by structured interviews of customer questionnaires."</p>

  <p>"random approaches to ascertain customer needs...tend to leave fundamental gaps...particularly if the questions themselves are derived and driven from consideration of existing products and customers' views of those products rather than from fundamental needs issues."</p>

  <p>"a PDS [Product Design Specification] must be comprehensive and unambiguous. If an experienced designer is asked to design something with a less than comprehensive [specification], he will almost, without thinking, fill in the gaps based on his experience and feelings; if these happen to be at variance with the true user needs, he will be designing to the wrong base."</p>

  <p>"The appearance of a product is a difficult thing to specify and therefore, in many instances, it is left to the designer; the complaints come afterward" - <em><strong>analogy here with CDPF, assume it will be sorted by the firmware engineer.</strong></em></p>

  <p>"[product liability] legislation considers 'product defect' as its primary basis [but] many defects are designed into a product through lack of adequate consideration of all the constraints at the outset." <em><strong>he proposes the term 'defect of specification' for such designed-in problems."</strong></em></p>

  <p>"Systematic design is essential at all levels"- <em><strong>characterises well what he owes to Simon in his understanding of design, contra participatory design and divergent/convergent practices associated with design thinking.</strong></em></p>

  <p>"[the] tendency to 'cut and run', and start engineering and developing the ideas further...should be avoided at all costs" <em><strong>doesn't seem to take account of prototyping as a productive concept-generation or confirmation design activity, even though he goes on to say...</strong></em></p>

  <p>"you need as many ideas as you can possibly generate - single solutions are usually a disaster."</p>

  <p>"design is not an excuse for trying to do impossible things outside the laws of physics" <em><strong>an interesting parallel concern to those who might specify behaviour without recognising its computational impossibility</strong></em></p>

  <h1><a href="file:/papers/06e603544b3dd7fdafda434f930cd519.pdf">A Framework for Organizing the Tools and Techniques of Participatory Design</a></h1>

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>Made me think about upstream and downstream contributions to a technology, as a conceptual model for design contributions. E.g. upstream users, downstream developers, with some form of faithful representations passing along the pipeline.</p>

  <p>Their framework contrasts the following 5 interlocking concepts; <strong><em>Tools, Toolkits, Techniques, Methods and Approaches</em></strong>.They also pull out <em><strong>Form</strong></em> (making, telling, enacting) <em><strong>Purpose</strong></em> (why; for probing? for priming to a domain? to understand their experience? to generate new ideas?) <em><strong>and Context</strong></em> (group size, composition, face to face/online, venue) as key reference points. The aim is to represent various PD practices within a common ontology.&#160;<br /></p>

  <h2>Concepts</h2>

  <h2>Quotations</h2>

  <p>"There is some confusion as to which tools and techniques to use, when, and for what purpose. Therefore we are proposing a framework to help organize the proliferation of tools, techniques and methods in hopes that the PD community will benefit by discussing relevant applications and identifying potential areas for further exploration."</p>

  <p>"The main tools and techniques originating in this tradition [of prototyping shared artefacts] have been scenario techniques drawing on approaches from drama and forum theatre, design games providing materials and setting rules for the design dialogue and mock up and prototyping techniques enabling participants to jointly construct prototypes despite different professional backgrounds or interest in the design project."</p>

  <p>"Other traditions within participatory design have given more concern to how non-designers can articulate design proposals in such a way that these can provide a starting point for subsequent professional development work."</p>

  <h1><a href="../papers/08609553fd9af148cccbad24ce15f095.pdf">EXPERIENCES USING COOPERATIVE INTERACTIVE STORYBOARD PROTOTYPING</a></h1>

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>They start with a design critique of a VHS and progress to the design of a test harness which explores experimenting with co-design of interfaces in real time. They claim..."By building on H y p e r C a r d we can use external c o m m a n d s and functions to extend possible user interaction modes beyond button p u s h i n g - - allowing developers to create fully functional interfaces such as the one we created for the PC-VCR."...but was it really fully-functional? Is this an example of people thinking that UI design is the same as software design. Did it actually record video!? If not, there may be many hidden aspects which weren't featured. How much does this matter? How can this be mitigated?</p>

  <p>They use a 'grey shade' for hiding complexity, later thought of as 'greyed out'&#160; - possible link to flight instrument where various things can be disclosed and offered in different circumstances, and more information is not necessarily good (also mentioned by John Cross related to his Medical instruments - face to face at Manteigas event).</p>

  <p>They explicitly discuss the link to 'Scandinavian' workplace democracy - the precursor of Participatory Design.</p>

  <h2>Concepts</h2>

  <h2>Quotations</h2>

  <p>"Storyboard prototyping can be defined as<br />
  ' . . . a technique designed to generate consensus and closure via a tangible, interactive systems concept. It permits users to participate in the requirements validation process, and it provides an audit trail of the requirements analysis process . . . . The presentation of the interactive storyboard to users and managers is intended to evoke comments and criticisms' [13, p. 39]"</p>

  <p>"Delay associated with production of the next version of the storyboard is a source of frustration for storyboard developers. Too much time between user review sessions leads to loss of cognitive momentum and can introduce errors to and perpetuate omissions in the development process."</p>

  <p>"[Cooperative Interactive Storyboard Prototyping] empowers users with tools and techniques encouraging them to interactively contribute to real-time, storyboard use, evalua-<br />
  tion and modification. Crucial here is the concept of the role of the user changing from reviewer to codeveloper."</p>

  <p>"CISP also provides situations in which users can evaluate the storyboard prototypes under realistic circumstances and modify them in real time."</p>

  <p>"According to Bodker and Gronbaek, a major obstacle is the developer's limited ability to respond smoothly to user ideas or requests for prototype changes during design sessions [6]."</p>

  <h1><a href="file:/papers/122532b39d9f9071b76392f7bee38ea0.pdf">Communities of Practice and Social Learning Systems<br /></a></h1>

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>This paper talks about 'communities of practice' as a social structure, which act as a foundation for 'learning' and are built around forms of 'competence' recognised internally to the community, ways of participating, artefacts, perspectives and forms of knowledge. Identity (updated term to replace Wenger's 'belonging'), trajectory and multimembership are presented as features of the CoP landscape from an individual's point of view. It originates as an analytical tool, to contrast the actual dynamics of social structures to the superficial networks and hierarchies and wishlists of management or authority, but it has since become 'instrumental' as a means of engineering social structures.</p>

  <p>Does CDPF need to be aware of the potential for dis-identification with programming as an obstacle to participant engagement. What can be done to overcome this?</p>

  <p>The following extract seems relevant to @ShrimpingIt as well...</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Managing one�s membership in existing communities: how do I contribute to communities I belong to or could belong to?</li>

    <li>Seeing a boundary to be bridged and becoming brokers using multimembership as a bridge across practices</li>

    <li>Being in a unique position to see the need for a community with the legitimacy to call it into being and becoming conveners</li>

    <li>Connecting someone, like a patient or a student, to a community that will enhance their learning capability</li>

    <li>Providing transversal connections in a context where vertical and horizontal accountability structures are disjointed</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Concepts</h2>

  <p>Boundaries of practice - a corrolary to communities of practice, indicating a separation between those who are 'involved' in a negotiated meaning, and those who aren't. An additional, linked concept 'active boundaries'.&#160;</p>

  <p>Dis-identification - rejection of the power plays and regime of accountability associated with a specific community.</p>

  <h2>Quotations</h2>

  <p>"A community of practice can be viewed as a social learning system. Arising out of learning, it exhibits many characteristics of systems more generally: emergent structure, complex relationships, self-organization, dynamic boundaries, ongoing negotiation of identity and cultural meaning..."</p>

  <p>"we produce physical and conceptual artifacts�words, tools, concepts, methods,&#160; stories, documents, links to resources, and other forms of reification�that reflect our shared experience and around which we organize our participation" - good summary of a boundary object, within a community of practice</p>

  <p>"On the one hand, we engage directly in activities, conversations, reflections, and other forms of personal <strong><em>participation</em></strong> in social life. On the other hand, we produce physical and conceptual artifacts�words, tools,<br />
  concepts, methods, stories, documents, links to resources, and other forms of <strong><em>reification</em></strong>�that reflect our shared experience and around which we organize our participation." - reification is a solid link to the notion of boundary object?</p>

  <p>"Artifacts without participation do not carry their own meaning; and participation without artifacts is fleeting, unanchored, and uncoordinated."</p>

  <p>" community...participants... define a �regime of competence,� ...by which they recognize membership. This competence includes ...understanding what matters, what the enterprise of the community is, and how it gives<br />
  rise to a perspective on the world" - links to the potential to share programmer "gambits" with non-programmers to help them participate in code design.</p>

  <p>"Learning is not just acquiring skills and information; it is becoming a certain person�a knower in a context where what it means to know is negotiated with respect to the regime of competence of a community."</p>

  <p>"Engagement ...can... be a way to explore a boundary if we can have enough access to the practice."</p>

  <p>"The regime of competence of a community of practice translates into a regime of accountability� accountability to what the community is about, to its open issues and challenges, to the quality of relationships in the community, to the accumulated products of its history. When an academic community expects a doctoral student to contribute something new through a dissertation, it first expects that student to do a literature review. This is a way to honor the history of learning of that community. Becoming accountable to history also enables the student to discover the learning edge of the practice, the places where a contribution makes sense and is possible. It is this double accountability to the past and the future of the practice that equips the student to contribute to its evolution as a full participant"</p>

  <p>"my colleague Jean Lave and I coined the term �community of practice� in the late 80�s"</p>

  <p>"Gillian Evans (2006) has observed some kids dis-identifying with school-based accountability because of their accountability to other communities they belong to on the street"</p>

  <p>" How can the practice become the curriculum? How can it be made visible and inspectable? What should participants do together to learn and benefit from the partnership?" <strong><em>does this question relate to what needs to be disclosed about programming to non-programmers?</em></strong></p>

    "The everyday skill, or coping as Dreyfus describes, is central to what we are familiar with. The familiarity with the world is not a skill that sometimes is used, and sometimes not. It is active all the time. Hence, to be a user in the first place is to be familiar with some- thing. We do not activate this most general skill only on certain occasions, it is active all the time.

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>Reinforces my suspicion that there's something immaterial which designers and users find hard to express, and underlines my choice of firmware for non-OS devices, where that is exactly the design domain - the bit which cannot be sketched. However, in the case of this paper, they are still operating in a domain where the foil of 'UI design' masks the lack of actual software specification.</p>

  <p>They look at the design of novel controls, by conceiving challenges which exceed the scope of existing controls, focusing on imagined 'projected' controls - <em>Radio</em> station controls and volume on a bedspread, <em>Shower</em> (flow and temperature) and <em>Stove</em> (burner and temperature) examples.&#160;</p>

  <p>Mentioned reframing (different context and social environment, for example) triggered different solutions. E.g. Team radio - a couple in bed using foot controls.</p>

  <h2>Concepts</h2>

  <h2>Quotations</h2>

  <p>"When designing novel GUI controls, interaction designers are challenged by the �immaterial� materiality of the digital domain; they lack tools that effectively support a reflecting conversation with the material of software as they attempt to conceive, refine, and communicate their ideas. To investigate this situation, we conducted two participatory design workshops."</p>

  <p>"Through a creative process of ideation (sketching) and iteration (prototyping), designers engage in a �conversation with materials� [29, 30], striving to find harmonious intersections between what is possible, acceptable, needed, and desired. As designers conceive of a new idea or refine the details of an existing idea, the materials they use begin to �talk back�, revealing new opportunities and challenges. For example, when sketching with a pencil on paper, designers can explore a product�s physical form, reacting as each line is added to the page."</p>

  <p>"designers cannot easily play with the material of software, making development of tacit knowledge much more difficult...many interaction designers lack the competency to effectively implement their ideas in software in order to critique them [28], significantly limiting reflection on action. Instead, designers often find themselves handing off static, annotated, screen designs"</p>

  <p>"Blueprints have evolved over time into a conventional form that has become embedded in the practice of architecture; however, such detailed, conventional artifacts do not yet exist for software<br />
  development."</p>

  <p>"Framing the output as a boundary object allows the developer to become the voice of the software,<br />
  allowing the conversation with material to also include the transfer of the concept from design to development; making the transfer a co-creative endeavor."</p>

  <h1><a href="../papers/621bbfcaea51d81c4b09bb3bfa2f01af.pdf">Schemata, Gambits and Precedent: Some Factors in Design Expertise</a></h1>

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>Referenced as a major conceptual foundation by Dan Lockton regards his "Design with Intent" workshopping cards.&#160; They talk about design 'gambits' drawing a parallel with chess players, who do not exhaustively or analytically approach a game, but instead their expertise relies on 'experience' and 'recognition' of the board state. Similarly, they explore studies of conversation within an architectural practice, and descriptions of two-dimensional images shared&#160; between graphical designers, concluding they rely on a shared base of 'precedent' references. They note the dominance of story, e.g. within the architectural practice, and characterise forms of memory in use as being 'episodic' (narrative) rather than 'semantic' (theoretical/verbal?)</p>

  <p>This suggests a line of enquiry for me, that users may be taught the value-system (win/lose analogy with chess) and the gambits of programming through preparing their recognition of problem situations and possible solutions. This could mean they can act intelligently within the program design space, without necessarily being coders. They may recognise the structure of a failure condition without necessarily having to demonstrate it (needing a digitally programmed prototype). With sufficient priming in this space, it may be possible for domain-led program design discussion to be sustained by non-programmers.</p>

  <p>They draw upon the concept of affordance as a proposed organising principle for precedents, so that designers can match problem cases to possible stories or previous scenarios.</p>

  <p>They interestingly draw out this contrast of being "solution focused" (designerly?) versus "problem focused" (analytical?). Could this relate to hacking versus computer science - combining designerly strategies with code?)</p>

  <h2>Concepts</h2>

  <h2>Quotations</h2>

  <p>"The paper concludes that design expertise cannot be understood by studying actions alone but that our research needs to concentrate on perception and recognition and that we will have to examine conversations and memories as much as drawings."</p>

  <p>"to get good data on this we need to study not just the actions, graphical outputs and finished designs of these designers but also the conversations they have with each other and their clients during their normal working practice"</p>

  <p>"for [high level thinking] to occur in design teams the schemata and gambits need to be shared to the extent that they can be named and communicated with simple references." - suggests a kind of test for the success of pedagogy to teach programming gambits to participants - can they use them as shared references.</p>

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>They look at the design of museum spaces and experiences as a PD process, then step back to analyse the results to understand the 'fictional spaces' which exist within creative workshops, as people imagine things which don't yet exist, and step away from the confines of reality.</p>

  <p>Emphasis on the space metaphor, and the problem transformations which designers do to recast these 'spaces' conceptually. They relate this to literary fictions, and measures of realism which are used in that parallel domain.</p>

  <p>In their case studies, they use 'obstructions' in a design brief as props to "mandate particular forms of imagining". However, they use these examples to pursue a more philosophical examination of fiction, as suggested by...</p>

  <p>"the [fictional space] perspective enables reflection on three aspects of design inquiries. First, it provides concepts for reflecting on how design inquiries are staged in terms of the props chosen and how these are intended to promote particular avenues for participants to pursue. Second, the perspective provides concepts for reflection in action as design inquiries unfold by highlighting the dynamic processes in which fictional truths are created and negotiated among participants. Third, the perspective provides means for reflecting on the outcomes of design inquiries in terms of understanding how participants create new constellations by conflating elements from existing practices with novel conceptions."</p>

  <h2>Concepts</h2>

  <h2>Quotations</h2>

  <p>"With inspiration from literary theory, it is argued that the production of fictional space may be understood in terms of participants practicing games of make-believe mediated by props."</p>

  <p>"Common to these approaches and to PD in general is an emphasis on designing with users as a situated phenomenon; a practice that takes place in particular settings, with particular people, and under particular circumstances and that these fundamentally shape what is envisioned and designed in the cooperation between designers and users" - relates to workshopping with Paraglider pilots in Manteigas.</p>

  <p>"what is given from the outset, however vague or ill-defined, is changed through the process. Design is thus always design of something given, but what that given is depends on what is designed. From a rational point of view, this state of affairs seems at best circular, at worst logically paradoxical." - discusses what is interesting about "design briefing" and the renegotiation of the problem itself (probably from within an assumed value system underlying the original request).</p>

  <p>"props may serve to coordinate imagination among participants. What is imagined and how the fictional space develops has both aspects of people enacting what is afforded by the materials provided (props) and people bringing to the table novel insights or perhaps changing the very structure of the fictional truths that make up the fictional space.

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>Lit review, covering experimental materials supporting 'conceptual modeling' in systems analysis and design, substantiated by 'meaningful tests of domain semantics' - "research aimed at empirically evaluating ... diagrammatic notations... to convey semantics of a real world domain". They contrast 'read' tasks and 'write' tasks in experiments, and focus on 'read' tasks. They proceed to analyse prior experiments within a model of evidential quality and procedural legitimacy which they outline at the beginning of the paper.</p>

  <p>They focus on formal validity questions, e.g. controlled variables in subject selection, choice of lab versus ex-lab. Four contrasting experimental design aspects are highlighted, independent variables, <strong><em>dependent measures, participants and procedures</em></strong>.</p>

  <p>Recommend 'informational equivalence' so that the semantic delivery of different representations. They see dependent measures, such as a test of competence which combines knowledge represented with prior knowledge, to be problematic. They point out that Subject Matter Experts must not be used! (though they accept this undermines external validity) [a methodological challenge for CDPF? Does it need a modelling formalism for firmware?]. They feel that 'scripts' or representations should not be removed during assessment, as this focuses more on learning than on content transmitted, and is more externally valid. They propose an approach to obfuscate details from information, making them 'semantically void' such that prior knowledge cannot be used.</p>

  <p>"The goal of software is to implement a solution to a problem that is defined by human intent alone. Some people have expertise in the problem domain - they are domain experts.

  <p>"For the creation of any software, two kinds of contributions need to be combined even though they are not at all similar: those of the domain providing the problem statement and those of software engineering providing the implementation. They need to be woven together to form the program."</p>

  <p>"The direct development workflow in use today (Figure 1) is the following: The domain expert communicates the problemstatement to the programmer. This is done in forms that can not be automatically transformed into code, such as specs, use cases, stories, and sketches. The programmer then weaves these intentions together with software engineering knowledge and implementation decisions and creates the source code that can run on a computer."</p>

  <p>The eight characteristics of boundary objects from the point of view of participants [ worth considering how many can be featured in the workshop]...</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Objects-in-the-making</em> - non ready-made, even if templated</li>

    <li><em>Build-in-affordances</em> to make a design develop or articulate its quality, e.g. placing bricks in the layout game, socially forces you to explain why it's good.</li>

    <li><em>Rules and instructions for use</em> e.g. which color pen to use for marking up.</li>

    <li>Facilitator-selected - the fact the experience is crafted by a facilitator was noted.</li>

    <li><em>Temporary learning space</em> the objects and context they create distance participants from daily routine and approaches.</li>

    <li><em>Location</em> where objects are used is significant to the way people engage with them</li>

    <li><em>Represent workshop outputs</em> the objects are a productive result of the effort and intent of the workshop, supporting incorporation into an ongoing design process, including a political character such as 'frozen boundary objects' presented to other actors.</li>

  <h2>Quotations</h2>

  <p>"Based on two case studies, we identify eight characteristics of boundary objects and their use, which make them particularly useful in PE design processes...The framework developed may serve to provide criteria to guide practitioners and intervention researchers in the selection of objects to facilitate a PE process."</p>

  <p>"Prototypes are physical or digital representations of a future artifact. Prototyping refers to the mutual learning process that takes place in a collaborative design setting."</p>

  <p>"Inspired by Horgen et al. (1999), we used workbooks with a selection of pictures from the current workplace, which workers could comment on, using colored pens (Fig.1). A three-color code was used to indicate, for example, good solution, problematic solution, and problem to be solved."</p>

  <p>"Boundary objects are needed that can create a common language, which allows all participants�� knowledge and ideas to be represented. Focusing on PE design, it is also important to identify boundary objects that have the ability to act as design objects. They must be objects-in-the-making."</p>

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>A very long (PhD thesis?),&#160; not yet read in full. Skipped to section on Facilitating Co-Design, in preparation for Manteigas. Discusses card-based design games for facilitation, to combine both catalysing ideas <em>and</em> documenting them. Can leave some voices unheard, only serve some constituencies (e.g. designers). 'Incident cards' and dice.</p>

  <h2>Concepts</h2>

  <p>Particularisation- defining and explicating all objects in a roleplay, Presencing - emphasising the present time in roleplay. Personalisation - increasing engagement by incorporating their own objects/elements. [credited to Seland]. Three categories of artefacts - verbal (written and spoken instructions, invitations, questions), institutional (values and norms of context) and material (props and physical context).</p>
