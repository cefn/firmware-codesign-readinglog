  <h1>Total Design: Integrated Methods for Successful Product Engineering - Stuart Pugh</h1>

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>Explores the notion of total design - practiced in the real world, as opposed to partial design - the normal way people encounter design when they are being taught it. The book rests on the notion that without specific interventions, people's partial design training will lead to problematic design outcomes. The book presents a very commercially-oriented model of design, with a strong emphasis on 'engineering' through to sales. It has an unreconstructed view of information flow forward in the product design process, (though this may be a result of an acknowledged view of the product design in hindsight). It uses concrete examples of 'total design' such as&#160; a lifting truck, a wind tunnel, surgical robotics. The 'waterfall' forward design approach is illustrated well by the conceptual diagrams (e.g. Figure 2.2 p 32 - outlines a set of sources proceeding to a formal 'product design specification', figure 2.9 p43 shows information flow from specification to sales, but not back again). A set of formal analysis approaches are proposed; <em><strong>Parametric analysis</strong></em> - a way in which product design spaces can be plotted parametrically to identify opportunities or outliers with respect to existing competitors. <em><strong>Needs analysis</strong></em> is about gathering evidence of customer need. <em><strong>Matrix analysis</strong></em> is a tickbox representation of competitors' products' features.</p>

  <p>In summary 'total design' adds up to not-getting-it-wrong and doesn't seem to have another definition, apart from perhaps taking the series of proposed approaches by Pugh and simply executing all of them in sequence.</p>

  <h2>Concepts</h2>

  <h2>Quotations</h2>

  <p>"misdirected engineering rigour will <em><strong>always</strong></em> gie rise to bad total design. This implies that design teams should always include non-engineers....Participants should be able to see how their differing partial design contributions fit into the whole scene. This is not a desirable objective; it is considered to be essential."</p>

  <p>"an analysis of any existing product will reveal that the main design flow is from market (user need) to sales...this activity will be referred to as the 'design core'.&#160;</p>

  <p>"Needs analysis is concerned with establishing the true needs of the customer, the 'voice of the customer'. This can be obtained by extensive examination of the views and reports of representative bodies, market data publications, (buying habits), reports giving official opinions and reactions to products in use and also by structured interviews of customer questionnaires."</p>

  <p>"random approaches to ascertain customer needs...tend to leave fundamental gaps...particularly if the questions themselves are derived and driven from consideration of existing products and customers' views of those products rather than from fundamental needs issues."</p>

  <p>"a PDS [Product Design Specification] must be comprehensive and unambiguous. If an experienced designer is asked to design something with a less than comprehensive [specification], he will almost, without thinking, fill in the gaps based on his experience and feelings; if these happen to be at variance with the true user needs, he will be designing to the wrong base."</p>

  <p>"The appearance of a product is a difficult thing to specify and therefore, in many instances, it is left to the designer; the complaints come afterward" - <em><strong>analogy here with CDPF, assume it will be sorted by the firmware engineer.</strong></em></p>

  <p>"[product liability] legislation considers 'product defect' as its primary basis [but] many defects are designed into a product through lack of adequate consideration of all the constraints at the outset." <em><strong>he proposes the term 'defect of specification' for such designed-in problems."</strong></em></p>

  <p>"Systematic design is essential at all levels"- <em><strong>characterises well what he owes to Simon in his understanding of design, contra participatory design and divergent/convergent practices associated with design thinking.</strong></em></p>

  <p>"[the] tendency to 'cut and run', and start engineering and developing the ideas further...should be avoided at all costs" <em><strong>doesn't seem to take account of prototyping as a productive concept-generation or confirmation design activity, even though he goes on to say...</strong></em></p>

  <p>"you need as many ideas as you can possibly generate - single solutions are usually a disaster."</p>

  <p>"design is not an excuse for trying to do impossible things outside the laws of physics" <em><strong>an interesting parallel concern to those who might specify behaviour without recognising its computational impossibility</strong></em></p>

  <h2>Authors</h2>

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>I have a suspicion that the (mainstream field) of Service Design could have a lot in common with Firmware from the point of view of having difficulties materialising the field of work. That is to say, the holistic asynchronous flow of events which combine together to deliver a service are equally hard to concretise, although we would expect users to be able to describe parts accurately, drawing on their common sense, in a way which is perhaps impossible with firmware, because humans can be deployed to deliver the service.</p>

  <h1><a href="file:/papers/06e603544b3dd7fdafda434f930cd519.pdf">A Framework for Organizing the Tools and Techniques of Participatory Design</a></h1>

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>Made me think about upstream and downstream contributions to a technology, as a conceptual model for design contributions. E.g. upstream users, downstream developers, with some form of faithful representations passing along the pipeline.</p>

  <p>Their framework contrasts the following 5 interlocking concepts; <strong><em>Tools, Toolkits, Techniques, Methods and Approaches</em></strong>.They also pull out <em><strong>Form</strong></em> (making, telling, enacting) <em><strong>Purpose</strong></em> (why; for probing? for priming to a domain? to understand their experience? to generate new ideas?) <em><strong>and Context</strong></em> (group size, composition, face to face/online, venue) as key reference points. The aim is to represent various PD practices within a common ontology.&#160;<br /></p>

  <h2>Concepts</h2>

  <h2>Quotations</h2>

  <p>"There is some confusion as to which tools and techniques to use, when, and for what purpose. Therefore we are proposing a framework to help organize the proliferation of tools, techniques and methods in hopes that the PD community will benefit by discussing relevant applications and identifying potential areas for further exploration."</p>

  <p>"The main tools and techniques originating in this tradition [of prototyping shared artefacts] have been scenario techniques drawing on approaches from drama and forum theatre, design games providing materials and setting rules for the design dialogue and mock up and prototyping techniques enabling participants to jointly construct prototypes despite different professional backgrounds or interest in the design project."</p>

  <p>"Other traditions within participatory design have given more concern to how non-designers can articulate design proposals in such a way that these can provide a starting point for subsequent professional development work."</p>

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>They start with a design critique of a VHS and progress to the design of a test harness which explores experimenting with co-design of interfaces in real time. They claim..."By building on H y p e r C a r d we can use external c o m m a n d s and functions to extend possible user interaction modes beyond button p u s h i n g - - allowing developers to create fully functional interfaces such as the one we created for the PC-VCR."...but was it really fully-functional? Is this an example of people thinking that UI design is the same as software design. Did it actually record video!? If not, there may be many hidden aspects which weren't featured. How much does this matter? How can this be mitigated?</p>

  <p>They use a 'grey shade' for hiding complexity, later thought of as 'greyed out'&#160; - possible link to flight instrument where various things can be disclosed and offered in different circumstances, and more information is not necessarily good (also mentioned by John Cross related to his Medical instruments - face to face at Manteigas event).</p>

  <p>They explicitly discuss the link to 'Scandinavian' workplace democracy - the precursor of Participatory Design.</p>

  <h2>Concepts</h2>

  <h2>Quotations</h2>

  <p>"Storyboard prototyping can be defined as<br />
  ' . . . a technique designed to generate consensus and closure via a tangible, interactive systems concept. It permits users to participate in the requirements validation process, and it provides an audit trail of the requirements analysis process . . . . The presentation of the interactive storyboard to users and managers is intended to evoke comments and criticisms' [13, p. 39]"</p>

  <p>"Delay associated with production of the next version of the storyboard is a source of frustration for storyboard developers. Too much time between user review sessions leads to loss of cognitive momentum and can introduce errors to and perpetuate omissions in the development process."</p>

  <p>"[Cooperative Interactive Storyboard Prototyping] empowers users with tools and techniques encouraging them to interactively contribute to real-time, storyboard use, evalua-<br />
  tion and modification. Crucial here is the concept of the role of the user changing from reviewer to codeveloper."</p>

  <p>"CISP also provides situations in which users can evaluate the storyboard prototypes under realistic circumstances and modify them in real time."</p>

  <p>"According to Bodker and Gronbaek, a major obstacle is the developer's limited ability to respond smoothly to user ideas or requests for prototype changes during design sessions [6]."</p>

For most software products, though, the design of the software is manifested through the usage of it (Holmlid, 2002, 2005; Bannon &amp; B�dker 1991), which in turn can be viewed as being mediated by its interface. At some point during system development the user interface will be programmed, just as the rest of the system."</p>

  <p>"For Loop and Hip programming is viewed as purely construction work. Basically this means that setting up a software development centre is similar to setting up an assembly factory, or acquiring production capacity for a component. The provisions for enabling component based software development is that the software can be modularized in components, that there is an architecture that defines the assembly of the components, and that there is an assembly process that directs the requirements for the development of components. This perspective resembles a traditional production-process perspective. With the position IxD argues for, that the design material is not like traditional industrial design material, the&#160;production-process perspective would not be accepted without good arguments."</p>

  <p>"if design decisions have not been made before programming time, these decisions will be made during programming time. This does not imply that programmers should be excluded from making such decisions; rather it implies that we need to have an interaction design strategy and direct design work."</p>

  <p>"some companies have succeeded with approaches such as; guidelines, programming design tools, design reviews, critique systems, design patterns, templates etc. They highlight the fact that the interaction design work of systems can not be dis-integrated from the development of the rest of the software product."</p>

  <p>"From software engineering perspectives, and thus with a focus on construction quality, there have been employed a varied set of methods, such as verification driven development, integration driven development, and feature based development, although<br />
  there is little said about design management aspects within these"</p>

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>This paper talks about 'communities of practice' as a social structure, which act as a foundation for 'learning' and are built around forms of 'competence' recognised internally to the community, ways of participating, artefacts, perspectives and forms of knowledge. Identity (updated term to replace Wenger's 'belonging'), trajectory and multimembership are presented as features of the CoP landscape from an individual's point of view. It originates as an analytical tool, to contrast the actual dynamics of social structures to the superficial networks and hierarchies and wishlists of management or authority, but it has since become 'instrumental' as a means of engineering social structures.</p>

  <p>Does CDPF need to be aware of the potential for dis-identification with programming as an obstacle to participant engagement. What can be done to overcome this?</p>

  <p>The following extract seems relevant to @ShrimpingIt as well...</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Managing one�s membership in existing communities: how do I contribute to communities I belong to or could belong to?</li>

    <li>Seeing a boundary to be bridged and becoming brokers using multimembership as a bridge across practices</li>

    <li>Being in a unique position to see the need for a community with the legitimacy to call it into being and becoming conveners</li>

    <li>Connecting someone, like a patient or a student, to a community that will enhance their learning capability</li>

    <li>Providing transversal connections in a context where vertical and horizontal accountability structures are disjointed</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Concepts</h2>

  <p>Boundaries of practice - a corrolary to communities of practice, indicating a separation between those who are 'involved' in a negotiated meaning, and those who aren't. An additional, linked concept 'active boundaries'.&#160;</p>

  <p>Dis-identification - rejection of the power plays and regime of accountability associated with a specific community.</p>

  <h2>Quotations</h2>

  <p>"A community of practice can be viewed as a social learning system. Arising out of learning, it exhibits many characteristics of systems more generally: emergent structure, complex relationships, self-organization, dynamic boundaries, ongoing negotiation of identity and cultural meaning..."</p>

  <p>"we produce physical and conceptual artifacts�words, tools, concepts, methods,&#160; stories, documents, links to resources, and other forms of reification�that reflect our shared experience and around which we organize our participation" - good summary of a boundary object, within a community of practice</p>

  <p>"On the one hand, we engage directly in activities, conversations, reflections, and other forms of personal <strong><em>participation</em></strong> in social life. On the other hand, we produce physical and conceptual artifacts�words, tools,<br />
  concepts, methods, stories, documents, links to resources, and other forms of <strong><em>reification</em></strong>�that reflect our shared experience and around which we organize our participation." - reification is a solid link to the notion of boundary object?</p>

  <p>"Artifacts without participation do not carry their own meaning; and participation without artifacts is fleeting, unanchored, and uncoordinated."</p>

  <p>" community...participants... define a �regime of competence,� ...by which they recognize membership. This competence includes ...understanding what matters, what the enterprise of the community is, and how it gives<br />
  rise to a perspective on the world" - links to the potential to share programmer "gambits" with non-programmers to help them participate in code design.</p>

  <p>"Learning is not just acquiring skills and information; it is becoming a certain person�a knower in a context where what it means to know is negotiated with respect to the regime of competence of a community."</p>

  <p>"Engagement ...can... be a way to explore a boundary if we can have enough access to the practice."</p>

  <p>"The regime of competence of a community of practice translates into a regime of accountability� accountability to what the community is about, to its open issues and challenges, to the quality of relationships in the community, to the accumulated products of its history. When an academic community expects a doctoral student to contribute something new through a dissertation, it first expects that student to do a literature review. This is a way to honor the history of learning of that community. Becoming accountable to history also enables the student to discover the learning edge of the practice, the places where a contribution makes sense and is possible. It is this double accountability to the past and the future of the practice that equips the student to contribute to its evolution as a full participant"</p>

  <p>"my colleague Jean Lave and I coined the term �community of practice� in the late 80�s"</p>

  <p>"Gillian Evans (2006) has observed some kids dis-identifying with school-based accountability because of their accountability to other communities they belong to on the street"</p>

  <p>" How can the practice become the curriculum? How can it be made visible and inspectable? What should participants do together to learn and benefit from the partnership?" <strong><em>does this question relate to what needs to be disclosed about programming to non-programmers?</em></strong></p>

  <p>"Human factors and design, together with user-centered processes, are often taken to be all there is to interaction design, but the hidden partner is the details of how things work when they are used. As they say, the devil is in the details, and this is a matter of programming."</p>

  <p>"Interactive programs are too complex for unaided human comprehension; instead, good user-interface-design requirements must be engineered into programs by rigorous, formal processes." [<em><strong>I disagree</strong></em>]</p>

  <p>"If a device �operates as designed,� it is often assumed to be designed correctly, even if (to more perceptive eyes) the incident is a symptom of bad design, a �system-induced user error.�</p>

  <p>"Why aren�t devices made consistent with best clinical practice, so that operator training becomes simpler, rather than the other way around? Why does the report say in its recommendation 10A that nurses should be trained that �mL� on an infusion pump means �mL per hour�[2]? Why does recommendation 10B ask purchasers (hospitals) to do human factors studies of pumps? The same answer to both questions is that for the time being manufacturers�and national regulatory processes�can�t be relied on, and hospitals therefore have to train nurses to cope with bad design."</p>

  <p>"The motivation of the present work is to make a contribution to user interface design, specifically to discuss ways of measuring usability from design, from specifications rather than implementations."</p>

  <p>"Ideally, of course, user interfaces should be empirically evaluated and then improved, but in practice many products are designed and then fobbed off to users, with little opportunity for improvements."</p>

  <p>"This paper suggests treating user interfaces as finite state machines, and using graph theory as an analytic framework. The approach is not contentious, but means that many (even obvious) faults in user interfaces will not be addressed."</p>

  <p>"although there may be a direct way to give the user a model, doing so can be assumed to interfere with the user's task"</p>

  <p>"we may be safe in assuming that the larger the length of a complete manual is, the less usable the system"</p>

    "The sequential ordering does not hold for tangible interaction, where activities happen in parallel, where the activity can be distributed across multiple devices and places.

    "The everyday skill, or coping as Dreyfus describes, is central to what we are familiar with. The familiarity with the world is not a skill that sometimes is used, and sometimes not. It is active all the time. Hence, to be a user in the first place is to be familiar with some- thing. We do not activate this most general skill only on certain occasions, it is active all the time.

This technique avoid spending too much time tweaking pixels and adding unnecessary details. Often, a designer may feel attached to an idea ff too much time and effort is spent creating it. The idea becomes precious and the designer will often be less responsive to critical feedback and less willing to change it."</p>

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>&#160;Their tripartite analysis of the requirements process is useful perhaps, to differentiate scope or stages in workshop processes.</p>

  <p>Their observation that RE researchers focus on the what rather than the how, may reveal one of the core issues here. Whilst specifying 'what' can appear to be a complete description, once you embark on the 'how' (having to implement the 'what'), other unspecified aspects emerge, which in practice project back onto the 'what' - e.g. interactions required in the device which are too complex to be feasible in the field, incorrect defaults which take no account of users' needs. This may link to the notion of 'non-functional' requirements (see wikipedia).</p>

  <h2>Quotations</h2>

  <p>"design requirements rather than software requirements as an inclusive term better characterizes all requirements issues within these ecosystems that need to be addressed at the crossroads of business development, software engineering, and industrial design"</p>

  <p>"[Requirements Engineering] is replete with analytical frameworks, standards for requirements quality, elicitation protocols, and modeling methodologies"</p>

  <p>"we adopt a widely employed and straightforward categorization of the requirements processes into three facets: (1) discovery, (2) specification,<br />
  and (3) validation and verification&#160; During discovery, designers develop an understanding of the application domain and infer specific design needs through consultation with stakeholders and other sources [18]. Requirements specification is both a noun and a verb in RE parlance. As a noun, a specification is the document in which the requirements for a design effort are articulated thus representing an agreement between the stakeholders<br />
  and the design team [16,24]. The verb suggests the process of developing and managing the specification document; it is the process by which the design team acquires, abstracts, and represents the requirements [17,22]. Finally, during requirements validation and verification designers ensure that the requirements are (1) of high quality, (2) by addressing the users� needs, (3) and being appropriate for the design effort, and (4) having no<br />
  inconsistencies or defects"</p>

  <p>"Requirements researchers have also stated that requirements are properly concerned with what is to be achieved by a design artifact,<br />

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>Reinforces my suspicion that there's something immaterial which designers and users find hard to express, and underlines my choice of firmware for non-OS devices, where that is exactly the design domain - the bit which cannot be sketched. However, in the case of this paper, they are still operating in a domain where the foil of 'UI design' masks the lack of actual software specification.</p>

  <p>They look at the design of novel controls, by conceiving challenges which exceed the scope of existing controls, focusing on imagined 'projected' controls - <em>Radio</em> station controls and volume on a bedspread, <em>Shower</em> (flow and temperature) and <em>Stove</em> (burner and temperature) examples.&#160;</p>

  <p>Mentioned reframing (different context and social environment, for example) triggered different solutions. E.g. Team radio - a couple in bed using foot controls.</p>

  <h2>Concepts</h2>

  <h2>Quotations</h2>

  <p>"When designing novel GUI controls, interaction designers are challenged by the �immaterial� materiality of the digital domain; they lack tools that effectively support a reflecting conversation with the material of software as they attempt to conceive, refine, and communicate their ideas. To investigate this situation, we conducted two participatory design workshops."</p>

  <p>"Through a creative process of ideation (sketching) and iteration (prototyping), designers engage in a �conversation with materials� [29, 30], striving to find harmonious intersections between what is possible, acceptable, needed, and desired. As designers conceive of a new idea or refine the details of an existing idea, the materials they use begin to �talk back�, revealing new opportunities and challenges. For example, when sketching with a pencil on paper, designers can explore a product�s physical form, reacting as each line is added to the page."</p>

  <p>"designers cannot easily play with the material of software, making development of tacit knowledge much more difficult...many interaction designers lack the competency to effectively implement their ideas in software in order to critique them [28], significantly limiting reflection on action. Instead, designers often find themselves handing off static, annotated, screen designs"</p>

  <p>"Blueprints have evolved over time into a conventional form that has become embedded in the practice of architecture; however, such detailed, conventional artifacts do not yet exist for software<br />
  development."</p>

  <p>"Framing the output as a boundary object allows the developer to become the voice of the software,<br />
  allowing the conversation with material to also include the transfer of the concept from design to development; making the transfer a co-creative endeavor."</p>

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>Interesting that they consider this boundary object could be used by both users and engineers, but also ethnographers reporting on how devices <em>actually were</em> used. Suggests to me that the right sort of representative material might be used in multiple different roles. How many such roles are there? This suggests at least three. (e.g. Engineers communicating to users the <em>constraints</em> or <em>behaviour</em> of the existing design; Users communicating what they think it <em>should</em> do; Usability experts reporting on what <em>actually</em> happens in use.</p>

  <h2>Quotations</h2>

  <p>"Scenarios are descriptions of concrete system behaviours. They may summarise the behaviour traces of an existing system. More typically, however, they are useful during planning and design to describe systems that do not yet exist in a tangible, usable form."</p>

  <p>"We suspect that comics-style narrative scenarios can be effective boundary objects. One example of how this might work would be the ways in which requirement engineers might use scenarios to talk about what they think will happen, while ethnographers might construct narratives with similar structure, but that describe or composite what does (or at least did) actually happen. In a well-designed system, the first sort of narrative might be heavily based on the second sort."</p>

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>&#160;They try to introduce goal-oriented processes, with Goal Cards, to steer investments, which are annotated with "Business Goals" [WHY], "Usage Goals", [HOW] "Steps" [WHAT]. Their statements below, concerning their Goal Cards positions them squarely as boundary objects within a software design process.</p>

  <h2>Field of Study</h2>

  <h2>Concepts</h2>

  <p>Goal Cards, Design Rationale [they contrast their work with Louridas and Loucopoulos 2000]</p>

  <h2>Quotations</h2>

  <p>"In the optimal development process, every design decision would increase the probability that the product will generate the expected business value.<br />
  However, due to the fact that the focus of systems development is rarely the product�s quality-in-use [Ehn 1997], there is no effective way of telling whether the design decision will actually generate the business value or not. What often seems to be forgotten is that the generated business value corresponds to the level of usage (number of users who actually use the product) and the product�s quality-in-use<br />
  (effectiveness, efficiency and user satisfaction when the product is used). In other words, business value<br />
  is generated through product usage."</p>

  <p>"One of the biggest problems in IT development is that design decisions are rarely made explicit during the development of the system. This means that there is no description of how the imaginary product will create expected values that will lead to the desired business goals, i.e. which attributes in the product contributes to the expected values and to what extent. Many design decisions are made without having the product's quality-in-use in focus...However, there is no effective business and usage based technique for discussing potential design decisions, or for explaining the rationale behind design decisions...In [the] worst case, decisions are made that steers the product's presentation, behaviour and content away from those attributes needed to create business value."&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

  <p>"In the second project, an Internet based history teaching tool, the project participants had extremely different backgrounds, ranging from artists to<br />
  programmers. In this case the primary benefit of the Goal Card was that it really helped the project team to form common view of the product design despite different perspectives."</p>

  <p>"Goal Cards differs from the concept of design rationale in the sense that it describes expected business and usage effects for any product decision, thus creating a chain of reasoning that can be reviewed by all stakeholders."</p>

  <p>Participatory Design, Co-Design</p>

  <h2>Quotations</h2>

  <p>"How can practice-based research from humanities and informatics conjoin (and diverge) in the practices and analyses of digital design? Are our findings different from those of other, related fields, such as visual design or urban planning, and in which ways do our specific theoretical and methodological approaches contribute to this? What are the relationships between modes of knowing and analysis drawn from the insights and practices of, respectively, designers and researchers?"</p>

  <p>"Digital design calls for an expanded concept of design, as working with the digital is different from other forms of designing. The digital opens up a discussion between research approaches grounded in technological design and in socio-cultural and humanistic inquiries"</p>

  <p>"This also calls for a reframing of the notion of use, shifting attention from a narrow concept of product use to the context and practices of use. Design is a situated social practice, and the designed artefacts can only be fully understood in use. Taking into account the evolving and often-participatory character of digital designs, we even have to consider designing for design after design, the design that users carry out in use (Ehn 2007; Telier et al. (forthcoming)). We can also look at situated use as where the idea behind the artefact and the reality of use meet."</p>

  <p>"Research in PD involves users as co-designers in the design process as a way to design artefacts and systems that the users themselves<br />
  consider of benefit to their activities"</p>

  <p>"Understanding the contextual complexities opens up a whole range of new design ideas. We have to add here that foundational to PD and CSCW is a deep commitment to socially embedding technologies in human practice and that both fields of research make use of a diversity of social science methods, among them ethnography. There is a strong overlap with the humanities here"</p>

  <p>"This book attempts a reflexive exploration of the diversity of approaches to digital design research that we seek to confront and combine. The intention of this book has not been to generate a synthesized, grand and unified theory of (digital) design. The authors have different and mixed academic backgrounds: informatics, information systems, pedagogy, anthropology, discourse analysis, linguistics, semiotics (new) media studies and literary theory, among others. We strongly believe that this diversity is a strength when moving into critical and reflective analysis of digital design and its contexts of construction and use. None of the perspectives or theories put forward in this book claims priority over others. The fact that our research is grounded in different epistemological traditions has been one of the main challenges in writing collaboratively."</p>

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>A PhD Dissertation by Published papers. It's incredibly resonant as indicated by the quotations below. I appreciate his distinction between users and prototypers (orthogonal to technical skill - about the relationship to the artifact).</p>

  <p>&#160;</p>

  <h2>Field of Study</h2>

  <h2>Concepts</h2>

  <p>Interaction Design,</p>

  <h2>Quotations</h2>

  <p>"On the one hand, prototypes can be powerful boundary objects and an effective way to share ideas, collaborate and communicate across functional boundaries within an organization, but on the other hand the (lack of) ownership of prototypes also plays an important role in the politics and power-relations within an organization."</p>

  <p>"The developers of the interactive prototype, e.g. interaction designers, are in a position to design it in a way that enables<br />
  and encourages different stakeholders to take ownership over it."</p>

  <p>"I demonstrate that involving non-designers in the making and shaping of the prototype enables them to take active part in the reflective learning process of prototyping, and develop a sense of ownership over the prototype...Since participants learn about the design space and limitations of the prototype, they are able to give specific feedback and input, which the interaction designer can implement."</p>

  <p>"Designing a flexible prototype in combination with supportive tools to be used by both interaction designers and non-designers during development is introduced as a way to open up the prototyping process to these users."</p>

  <p>"the prototype itself is an object of design, with its users and use context, which deserves further attention."</p>

  <p>"Prototypes ...become the �essential medium for information, interaction, integration, and collaboration� (Schrage 1996).</p>

  <p>"I describe the role of interaction design prototypes in new product development and relate this to discussions in the literature on prototype fidelity, ownership and users"</p>

  <p>"Prototypes occupy the space between fluid concepts and rigid products, and play an important role in the transition from the one to the other."</p>

  <p>"Prototypes can be powerful boundary objects (Carlile 2002), enabling team members to share ideas, communicate and discuss, but this requires bringing in these people at the right time (Schrage 1996)."</p>

  <p>"Showing the prototype later in the process is risky too, since it is often costly to make changes, and developers run the risk of defending design suggestion they invested in, rather than being open to suggestions (cf. Rettig 1994)."</p>

  <p>"It is in the making of prototypes that the prototyper runs into design constraints, makes design decisions, evaluates its implications and thus gets to know the prototype intimately. During this process, interaction designers engage in �thinking through prototyping� (Klemmer et al. 2006), which is a reflective learning process (cf. Sch�n 1983; Hartmann et al. 2006). This learning is largely tacit; it is not easily transferred by demonstrating the prototype to others, and without this knowledge it can be hard to make useful suggestions, i.e. suggestions that are on the right level of detail and can be implemented. However, involving others in the making of a prototype is not as straightforward as it may seem. Prototyping is an expert activity, requiring some technical knowledge, and can take a long time."</p>

  <p>"Different approaches and methods to develop prototypes have been described and one of the central discussions in the literature has been on what level of detail or fidelity an interaction design prototype is most appropriate in relation to the stage of the project and the type of feedback the designers seek to get with the prototype."</p>

  <p>"When introducing paper prototyping, Rettig (1994) describes five problems with high-fidelity prototypes in the context of software development. They �take too long to build and change� making them ill-suited for early development, �Reviewers and testers tend to comment on �fit and finish� issues� which is a type of feedback that is less relevant in early development, �Developers resist changes� since they invest a lot in the prototype and grow affectionate of it, �A prototype in software can set expectations that will be hard to change� meaning that once others, e.g. a client or user, see the prototype, they will expect it to continue along that path and �A single bug in a hi-fi prototype can bring a test to a complete halt�.</p>

  <p>"Combining the advantages of both [computer-based and paper-based] approaches, without the disadvantages is the �holy grail� I have been seeking throughout my experiences as an interaction designer, both in education, industry and research."</p>

  <p>"Klemmer et al. pose that �[prototypes] themselves embody design ideas or specifications, render them concrete and, in doing so, inform the designer�s thinking�"</p>

  <h1><a href="../papers/621bbfcaea51d81c4b09bb3bfa2f01af.pdf">Schemata, Gambits and Precedent: Some Factors in Design Expertise</a></h1>

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>Referenced as a major conceptual foundation by Dan Lockton regards his "Design with Intent" workshopping cards.&#160; They talk about design 'gambits' drawing a parallel with chess players, who do not exhaustively or analytically approach a game, but instead their expertise relies on 'experience' and 'recognition' of the board state. Similarly, they explore studies of conversation within an architectural practice, and descriptions of two-dimensional images shared&#160; between graphical designers, concluding they rely on a shared base of 'precedent' references. They note the dominance of story, e.g. within the architectural practice, and characterise forms of memory in use as being 'episodic' (narrative) rather than 'semantic' (theoretical/verbal?)</p>

  <p>This suggests a line of enquiry for me, that users may be taught the value-system (win/lose analogy with chess) and the gambits of programming through preparing their recognition of problem situations and possible solutions. This could mean they can act intelligently within the program design space, without necessarily being coders. They may recognise the structure of a failure condition without necessarily having to demonstrate it (needing a digitally programmed prototype). With sufficient priming in this space, it may be possible for domain-led program design discussion to be sustained by non-programmers.</p>

  <p>They draw upon the concept of affordance as a proposed organising principle for precedents, so that designers can match problem cases to possible stories or previous scenarios.</p>

  <p>They interestingly draw out this contrast of being "solution focused" (designerly?) versus "problem focused" (analytical?). Could this relate to hacking versus computer science - combining designerly strategies with code?)</p>

  <h2>Concepts</h2>

  <h2>Quotations</h2>

  <p>"The paper concludes that design expertise cannot be understood by studying actions alone but that our research needs to concentrate on perception and recognition and that we will have to examine conversations and memories as much as drawings."</p>

  <p>"to get good data on this we need to study not just the actions, graphical outputs and finished designs of these designers but also the conversations they have with each other and their clients during their normal working practice"</p>

  <p>"for [high level thinking] to occur in design teams the schemata and gambits need to be shared to the extent that they can be named and communicated with simple references." - suggests a kind of test for the success of pedagogy to teach programming gambits to participants - can they use them as shared references.</p>

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>They follow through a procurement process to try and figure out where the usability part happens and who has responsibility for it (supplier or procurer). They find that it falls between the gaps, and propose engaging much earlier with the 'how' and usability questions, and engaging professionals to do so, because the procurement staff, untrained in usability, found confronting usability issues hard .</p>

  <h2>Concepts</h2>

  <h2>Quotations</h2>

  <p>"Difficulties also arose because the tools that they used were based on idealized models of how users worked."</p>

  <p>"Procurers, on the other hand, have relied on suppliers to create usable systems and have not focused explicitly on usability issues in their procurements (Holmlid &amp; Artman, this<br />
  volume). Unfortunately, although <em>it might seem obvious to expect that the system you purchase should be usable and useful this is seldom the case</em>. An important reason is that usability issues have not been dealt with consciously in organisations or projects and have been separated in development processes" [my italics]</p>

  <p>"another reason why usability activities are often omitted in contract development is that the activities do not seem to add much to what has already been done in the procurement, even though this work may not have focused on actual use at all"</p>

  <p>"the user-centred design process can be seen as divided into two stages. The first stage, the �what� stage, aims at defining what kind of system and functionality that will solve identified user needs. The second stage, the �how� stage, addresses how the interaction with the identified functionality should be designed."</p>

  <h2>Concepts</h2>

  <h2>Quotations</h2>

  <p>"PD research began in the mid 1970�s in reaction to the ways in which computer-based systems were introduced in the workplace"</p>

  <p>"The pioneering work of Nygaard and his associates in the NJMF project (Nygaard, 1979) was the foundation upon which later PD<br />
  projects, the Swedish DEMOS project (Ehn and Sanberg, 1979) and the Danish DUE project (Kyng and Mathiassen, 1982), were launched. The strategy included a research agenda in which researchers and local trade unions explored the potential and actual consequences of introducing specific computer-based systems into the workplace (Arena A) and developed goals and strategies for workers and their unions to pursue in relation to management�s technological initiatives (Arena B)."</p>

  <p>"management�s goals and strategies often were built into the new systems and were reinforced by organizational distributions of power, making it difficult to alter the technology to fit workers� needs and interests. Researchers and workers were interested in determining if it would be possible to design, develop, and implement technologies which took as their starting point the needs and interests of workers."</p>

  <p>"three basic requirements for participation outlined by Kensing (1983): (1) access to relevant information, (2) the possibility for taking an independent position on the problems, and (3) participation in decision making. They add two additional requirements: (4) the availability of appropriate participatory development methods and (5) room for alternative technical and/or organizational arrangements."</p>

  <p>"Of central importance is the development of meaningful and productive relations between those charged with technology design and those who must live with its consequences."</p>

  <p>"At one end of the spectrum, worker participation is limited to providing designers with access to workers� skills and experiences. The workers<br />
  have little or no control over the design process or its outcome...Workers are asked to participate in those aspects of the project where their input is viewed as valuable (e.g. description of current work practices and testing/evaluation of technology) but left out of most technology-related decisions....At the other end of the spectrum...workers participate in negotiations over how projects are organized and what outcomes are desired. They take an active part in (1) the analysis of needs and possibilities, (2) the evaluation and selection of technology components, (3) the design and prototyping of new technologies, and (4) the organizational implementation."</p>

  <p>She is looking to present a model for 'screenless' [my term] interactions with general purpose computing, and casting around for references and examples which could underpin it, and figuring out what aspects would need to be taken account.</p>

  <p>She discusses Gibson, Norman, but also Dourish, who explores Heidegger present-at-hand and ready-at-hand, and moves towards an analysis of coupling between embodied interaction and meaning, making interaction effective (make things happen) though doesn't seem to turn this into design&#160; design principles.</p>

  <h2>Field of Study</h2>

  <h2>Concepts</h2>

  <p>Affordance [credited to Gibson 1977], Gulf of Execution, Gulf of Evaluation</p>

  <h2>Quotations</h2>

  <p>"the importance of affordance needs to be emphasized in interface design, as it points to what we pay attention to when interacting with an object, how we perceive it as possible to use. It therefore plays a key role in deciding what a user most likely will do when operating an interface."</p>

  <p>"The dominant interface for personal computers�the graphical user interface�is highly ocularcentric, where only parts of the body apparatus (eyes and hands) are addressed in the interface directly. As an increasing amount of information, life experience and human contact is channeled through it, the desktop computer system, becomes increasingly inadequate to fully represent these actions. Any prosthesis added to or used in conjunction with the body and any part of the sensory apparatus neglected will define our interaction with information. Information gathered by the somesthetic�the touch and proprioceptic senses�constitute a significant component in the way we form hypotheses about what an object is, and how it can be manipulated. By addressing the somesthetic senses in computer interfaces, we can achieve richer and more intuitive interactive experiences."</p>

  <p>"representation of functionality and possible user actions is key to any computational environment. A user interface sets the stage for interaction between man and machine. It represents an environment, where a user can perform certain tasks and hold cues to how the same user can manipulate this environment according to his/her needs and desires"</p>

  <p>"Coupling is a strong concept for understanding the how we can design meaningful relationships between man and objects. It points to the significance of designing objects with a conceptual identity, that equally encompasses the object as a thing in it itself as well as the actions it can assist the user in performing." [credited to Dourish 2001]</p>

  <p>"Norman looks at interfaces of specialized machines, such as the early video game consoles and household appliances, and attributes their success in the one-to-one relationship between the input device (whether a button, lever, pot or slider) and the action it performs. Norman claims that ideally �both the interface and the computer would be invisible� and that only �the task that would be visible, the task and the tool being used to accomplish the task� (217). User interfaces should be designed, based on an investigation and understanding of the tasks a user wants to accomplish with a computer."<br /></p>

  <h2>Authors</h2>

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>&#160;Followed this thread to see if commonalities with Service Design (though not co-design in this case) means commentators draw on similar themes to that of Firmware. This is not only in terms of being overlooked, or considered too hard to model, but also perhaps techniques which could be transferred because of this parallel. Indeed I found a lot in common - with immateriality and temporality specifically flagged in ways which apply directly also to Firmware.</p>

  <h2>Field of Study</h2>

  <h2>Concepts</h2>

  <h2>Quotations</h2>

  <p>"Service(s) are fluid, dynamic, and frequently co-produced in real time by customers, employees, and technology, often with few static physical properties. Thus, many of the invention protocols and prototype design techniques used for physical goods, hard technologies, and software do not work well for human and interactive services, or at least they demand significant adaptation to address service innovation challenges"</p>

  <p>"The purpose of this article is to describe one such technique�service blueprinting�a customer-focused approach for service innovation and service improvement"</p>

  <p>"One of the most distinctive characteristics of services is their process nature. 10 Unlike physical goods, services are dynamic, unfolding over a period of time through a sequence or constellation of events and steps. The service process can be viewed as a chain or constellation of activities that allow the service to function effectively."</p>

  <p>"Service blueprints allow all members of the organization to visualize an entire service and its underlying support processes, providing common ground from which critical points of customer contact, physical evidence, and other key functional and emotional experience clues can be orchestrated."</p>

  <p>"What is needed is a means of presenting the activities, relationships, and interdependencies of a service process in an objective and precise manner such that it is methodologically structured, but flexible enough to allow creativity to flow."</p>

  <p>"During the final service design stages, the service concept is likely to be refined over a series of iterations to the point at which a final, comprehensive blueprint can be produced. All relevant parties should be involved in this process, including in many cases customers or clients. The ultimate task is for each functional area involved in delivering the service to translate the final blueprint into detailed implementation plans to support their activities within the blueprint. Departmental sub-processes can be magnified, rendered in fine detail, and blueprinted on their own as sub-documents of the main blueprint. The main blueprint forms a common point of reference for all parties concerned with achieving a successful launch of the service. It also serves as a focal point for later refinements or last-minute changes."</p>

  <p>"Service blueprinting... could help solve problems preemptively; and it was able to identify failure points in a service operation...[It] was further developed to distinguish between onstage and backstage activities. These key components still form the basis of the technique and its most important feature, that of illuminating the customer�s role in the service process."</p>

  <p>"service blueprinting is not as complex or as formal as some business process modeling tools such as UML. Service blueprints are<br />
  relatively simple and their graphical representations are easy for all stakeholders involved � customers, managers, front-line employees � to learn, use, and even modify to meet a particular innovation�s requirements."</p>

  <p>"There are five components of a typical service blueprint...<br />
  � Customer Actions,<br />
  � Onstage/Visible Contact Employee Actions,<br />
  � Backstage/Invisible Contact Employee Actions,<br />
  � Support Processes, and<br />
  � Physical Evidence."</p>

  <p>"Customer actions are depicted chronologically across the top of the blueprint...they are typically laid out first so that all other activities can be seen as supporting the value proposition offered to or co-created with the customer. The next critical component is the �onstage/visible contact employee actions,� separated from the customer by the line of interaction...The next significant component of the blueprint is the �backstage/invisible contact employee actions,� separated from the onstage actions by the very important line of visibility. Everything that appears above the line of visibility is seen by the customer, while everything below it is invisible...The fourth critical component of the blueprint is �support processes� separated from contact employees by the internal line of interaction"</p>

  <h2>Authors</h2>

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>&#160;They have explored using paper prototyping and ethnography within a HCI course, teaching computer scientists. I like their distinction between a Software Designer and a Software Engineer. Resonates very strongly with my own view.</p>

  <p>Paper provides a nice overview of the intent and differences between techniques such as User-Centred Design, Human-Centered Systems, Participatory Design and Contextual Design. Particularly good summary of Ethnography.</p>

  <h2>Field of Study</h2>

  <h2>Concepts</h2>

  <p>Contextual Design, Ethnography</p>

  <h2>Quotations</h2>

  <p>"Software designers need to apply methods that provide insights into the user's mental model of the application's target task and to invite the user to be an active participant in the design process."</p>

  <p>"While the software programmer/engineer is concerned with developing reliable, robust, and maintainable software, the software designer is concerned with creating products that fit within the user's overall activities, enhance productivity, and produce a satisfying experience"</p>

  <p>"Left to their own devices, computer programmers take a "systems-centered point of view", concerned about "how the software works and what parts of it do what" [8, p. 217-218]."</p>

  <p>"Contextual design relies on ethnographic techniques from anthropology [10, 19, 15, 4, 5]. Ethnography is a method of research in which the researcher gathers data within a natural setting that involves a dynamic network o f interrelated variables. No attempt is made to control variables within the setting, for this could alter or destroy the phenomenon being studied. The purpose o f ethnographic research is to attempt to understand what is happening naturally in the setting, and through interpreting the data gathered to see what implications can be formed from the data."</p>

  <p>"The final product produced from an ethnographic study should be a 'thick description" of the situation, so that the situation appears sufficiently realistic, and so that others in examining the description can determine whether the implications drawn from the study can be applied to other settings."</p>

  <p>"HCI Students [after being taught Participatory Design] lamented that while they now understood the way design should be done, based on their experiences "unfortunately that is not the way it is done in the real world.""</p>

  <h2>Authors</h2>

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>Author on knowledge transfer, boundaries, recommended by Patrick. The scenario I'm looking at is very much simpler than their "Beta motors" example - just users and firmware engineers. They emphasise the relevance of knowledge transfer in the early phases of product design, and firmware co-design is almost completely the opposite end of this - the product is mostly settled. Their case concerns complex interdependencies amongst multiple specialist groups. Core concepts are "difference and dependence." meaning the separation of different specialists, as well as their need to get along, or resolve things together. On this analysis, users and engineers max out both dimensions.</p>

  <p>He discusses the use of a 'clay model' (carving of a car?) as a kind of boundary object, or in his terms a kind of 'knowledge' which failed in certain ways to accommodate new conflicts and transfers between teams with different function in delivering a new car design. He evolves the term boundary object to consider "boundary processes" and "boundary infrastructure"</p>

  <h2>Quotations</h2>"The framework describes three progressively complex types of boundaries� syntactic, semantic and pragmatic�each managed by a different process�transfer, translation and transformation."

  <p>"Each increasingly complex boundary requires a more complex process to facilitate communication and innovation across specialized forms of knowledge."</p>

  <p>"From a knowledge perspective, differences at a boundary arise from variation in the type of skills and backgrounds or amount of experience between individuals or groups."</p>

  <p>"When a shared syntax or language sufficiently specifies the differences and dependencies at the boundary the boundary is �unproblematic;� the primary concern becomes �processing� or transferring knowledge through this shared syntax."</p>

  <p>"successful movements of knowledge occur when the parties are specialized in the same type of activity, so the primary difference is only that the sender is experienced in the best practice and the receiver is not."</p>

  <p>"The value of a syntactical approach to managing knowledge across a boundary is realized when a shared and stable syntax/language exists. Based on this knowledge can be efficiently transferred at the boundary. Such a shared and stable syntax/language is constructed from previous efforts at a boundary to address the critical differences and dependencies between the two groups�and once established only the costs of transferring knowledge are faced at the boundary."</p>"Under these conditions a shared and sufficient syntax that had been used in the past is no longer able to address the novel differences and dependencies which arise. So, while a shared syntax is necessary, it is not always sufficient to address all conditions at a boundary."<br />
  <br />
  "A semantic approach to crossing a boundary recognizes that problems of interpretation exist because the contexts in which people develop their knowledge are different or as novelty increases, interpretive or semantic differences as to what a word, measurement or outcome means arise at a boundary."<br />
  <br />
  "Frequently highlighted in the community of practice literature is the role of �stories� as an effective means of sharing knowledge and meaning (Wenger, 1998). In Orr�s (1996) study of Xerox repairman, �war stories� proved an effective tool in sharing knowledge about the complex technical and social situations that arise when repairing a copier."<br />
  <br />
  "When moving knowledge across [a] boundary often the problem is one of different interests, not just different meanings that need to be reconciled."<br />
  <br />
  "To understand the problematic nature of knowledge, it must be understood as localized, embedded and invested in the tasks, methods and outcomes of a specific practice (i.e., knowledge-in-practice). Knowledge is costly to develop (i.e., education, training, experience) and to change, so it should be seen as �at stake� for the individuals in a given practice (Bourdieu and Wacquant, 1992). This helps us see more clearly why accommodating the knowledge of another group is not a neutral or costless effort. The cost for any group dealing with increasing novelty at a boundary is not just the cost of learning about what is new. It is also the costs of adjusting or transforming their �current� ways of doing things to accommodate the knowledge developed by another group to collaborate at a boundary."<br />
  <br />
  "a complex boundary process has to be developed where current and more novel forms of knowledge can be represented, learned about, and then jointly transformed"<br />
  <br />
  "the clay model�s representational capacity to support such a pragmatic process was undermined as the conditions at the boundary became increasingly novel during the 80�s and early 90�s The clay model could no longer represent the differences and dependencies that were relevant across the four groups involved as it did not provide a means for them to collectively make trade-offs and transform their current knowledge."<br />
  <br />
  "I have identified three following characteristics...that we might expect to see in an effective boundary process: establishes a shared language to represent knowledge; provides a concrete means of specifying differences and dependencies; and facilitates a method in which individuals can jointly transform the knowledge used"<br />
  <br />
  "A climate control engineer summed this up nicely, when he said, �we disagree sooner and know what we are disagreeing about more productively when we have a shared basis to compare our requirements.�<br />
  <br />
  "The first characteristic required to effectively manage knowledge across a pragmatic boundary is the development of some shared language or syntax to represent knowledge at the boundary...The second characteristic required to manage knowledge across a pragmatic boundary is that the individuals involved need the ability to represent their preferences to others...The third characteristic required to manage knowledge across a pragmatic boundary is that the process or tool can be used to alter or transform the knowledge being used at the boundary."<br />
  <br />
  "the ability and willingness of individuals to change their knowledge or position only emerges when a process of identifying how it negatively impacts others is established"<br />
  <br />
  "The gap at many boundaries cannot be resolved with one try, but requires an iterative process of closing the gap�experimenting and shaping alternatives and solutions overtime....<br />

  <h2>Authors</h2>

  <p>Richard M. Young, T.R.G. Green and Tony Simon</p>

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>A PUM (programmable user model) is a boundary object for describing the behaviour (and state of mind) of a user in order to permit more precise specification of usability proposals or concerns.</p>

  <p>Contrasts with the model advocated by Alan Dix in his preamble to "Formal Methods for Interactive Systems" where he advocates modelling the system from the point of view of the user. This is very strongly about modelling the user.</p>

  <p>Related: GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods and Selection rules Card et al), KLM (Keystroke Level Modelling) and Methods-Time Measurement also linked to this - a quality metric not unlike Thimbleby's 'time to read manual' as a quantitative metric.</p>

  <h2>Quotations</h2>

  <p>"A Programmable User Model (PUM) is a psychologically constrained architecture which an interface designer is invited to program to simulate a<br />
  user performing a range of tasks with a proposed interface. It provides a novel way of conveying psychological considerations to the designer, by<br />
  involving the designer in the process of making predictions of usability."</p>

  <p>"The Human Factors advisor might reply "It's a confusing design, people won't be able to use it". the designer will reject the judgement (because it is<br />
  simply the advisor's word against the designer's) and will find it genuinely unhelpful (because of the lack of specific diagnosis and guidance)"</p>

  <p>"guidelines would indicate something like: "Users can retain at most four items of changing information; design the interface so that they never need to store more...suppose... that we present the designer with a programmable architecture that has only four slots (say) for dynamic information ...Then the designer has to program the PUM respecting the constraint, or else the model will make errors when it runs."</p>

  <p>"Users deciding on their next action may need to gather and weigh evidence from a number of different sources and lines of reasoning, such as: previous experience with the system; remembered instructions for performing the current task; analogies from other tasks or everyday behaviour;<br />
  information on or derivable from the screen; examples in a manual; and so on."</p>

  <p>"[Mumford] believed that neither change nor management are ends in themselves. Management needs to consider ethical<br />
  and social issues that are intrinsically linked to all social change. In order to be able to manage change in an acceptable<br />
  manner, participation of those who are affected by it should be encouraged. Participation in decision making, in particular<br />
  regarding the design and use of technology, should lead to greater employee satisfaction and higher productivity, and<br />
  better use of local knowledge, thereby furthering employers' goals."</p>

  <p>"Socio-technical systems design provides a new worldview of what constitutes quality of working life and humanism at<br />
  work. It facilitates organizational innovation by recommending the removal of many elite groups and substituting flatter<br />
  hierarchies, multiskilling and group decision-taking. It wants to replace tight controls, bureaucracy and stress with an<br />
  organization and technology that enhances human freedom, democracy and creativity" (credited to Mumford, 2003 p. 262).</p>

  <p>"the critical intention is normative in that it aims to change the way we act. This normative intention cannot result from mere observation of the world. Critical research, therefore, must implicitly contain a normative premise that is based on some sort of ethical foundation."</p>

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>They look at the design of museum spaces and experiences as a PD process, then step back to analyse the results to understand the 'fictional spaces' which exist within creative workshops, as people imagine things which don't yet exist, and step away from the confines of reality.</p>

  <p>Emphasis on the space metaphor, and the problem transformations which designers do to recast these 'spaces' conceptually. They relate this to literary fictions, and measures of realism which are used in that parallel domain.</p>

  <p>In their case studies, they use 'obstructions' in a design brief as props to "mandate particular forms of imagining". However, they use these examples to pursue a more philosophical examination of fiction, as suggested by...</p>

  <p>"the [fictional space] perspective enables reflection on three aspects of design inquiries. First, it provides concepts for reflecting on how design inquiries are staged in terms of the props chosen and how these are intended to promote particular avenues for participants to pursue. Second, the perspective provides concepts for reflection in action as design inquiries unfold by highlighting the dynamic processes in which fictional truths are created and negotiated among participants. Third, the perspective provides means for reflecting on the outcomes of design inquiries in terms of understanding how participants create new constellations by conflating elements from existing practices with novel conceptions."</p>

  <h2>Concepts</h2>

  <h2>Quotations</h2>

  <p>"With inspiration from literary theory, it is argued that the production of fictional space may be understood in terms of participants practicing games of make-believe mediated by props."</p>

  <p>"Common to these approaches and to PD in general is an emphasis on designing with users as a situated phenomenon; a practice that takes place in particular settings, with particular people, and under particular circumstances and that these fundamentally shape what is envisioned and designed in the cooperation between designers and users" - relates to workshopping with Paraglider pilots in Manteigas.</p>

  <p>"what is given from the outset, however vague or ill-defined, is changed through the process. Design is thus always design of something given, but what that given is depends on what is designed. From a rational point of view, this state of affairs seems at best circular, at worst logically paradoxical." - discusses what is interesting about "design briefing" and the renegotiation of the problem itself (probably from within an assumed value system underlying the original request).</p>

  <p>"props may serve to coordinate imagination among participants. What is imagined and how the fictional space develops has both aspects of people enacting what is afforded by the materials provided (props) and people bringing to the table novel insights or perhaps changing the very structure of the fictional truths that make up the fictional space.

  <p>"The focus on technologies-in-practice also allows an examination of the extent to which users realize designers' intentions for a technology....It has long been recognized that technologies are often not used as designed or intended (Bijker 1995, von Hippel 1988), but generating an adequate understanding of how, where, and why the slippage between design and use occurs in practice has been difficult. By distinguishing between technologies as artifacts and technologies-in-practice, we have a way to explore and explain this process."</p>

  <p>"The first type of enactment may be characterized in terms of <strong><em>inertia</em></strong>, where users choose to use technology to retain their existing way of doing things...The second type of enactment may be characterized in terms of <strong><em>application</em></strong>, where people choose to use the new technology to augment or refine their existing ways of doing things...The third type of enactment may be characterized in terms of <em><strong>change</strong></em>, where people choose to use the new technology to substantially alter their existing way of doing things"</p>

  <p>"future research could benefit from attending more carefully to the meanings and emotional attachments that users develop for the technologies they use."</p>

  <p>"By not examining or understanding what actually happens during use of technology, researchers and managers miss the crucial point, that it is whether and how people interact with technology in their day-to-day activities-not the mere presence of the technology on the desktop or factory floor-that influences performance outcomes and consequences."</p>

  <p>"These structures of technology use (technologies-in-practice) are not fixed or given, but constituted and reconstituted through the<br />
  everyday, situated practices of particular users using particular technologies in particular circumstances. By attending to such ongoing (re)constitution, a practice lens entails the examination of emergence, improvisation, and change over time as people reconfigure their technologies or alter their habits of use, and thereby enact different technologies-in-practice."</p>

  <p>"To find the most productive use of a new technology, avoiding all unexpectedly negative side-effects, you should systematically study all possible options and all their direct and indirect consequences. Because of bounded rationality, however, this is obviously impossible. Instead, improvements are typically made by trial-and-error, where first the most obvious applications are tried out, and users slowly become aware of their positive and negative effects. On the basis of that experience, they learn how to avoid clearly unproductive applications. They then try out minor variations or<br />
  improvements on the apparent �best practices�, and perhaps carry out a few more daring experiments that may open wholly new domains of application. They thus gradually discover more productive ways to use this same technology, ending up with initially unimagined uses."</p>

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>&#160;Tesler worked at Xerox Parc credited for early work on thinking about appropriate implementations of functions, e.g. avoiding complex modes [his numberplate is NOMODES]. He went on to lead some important work at Apple</p>

  <h2>Field of Study</h2>

  <h2>Concepts</h2>

  <h2>Quotations</h2>

  <p>"Findings from my early studies at Xerox PARC showed that modes were very difficult for people to deal with.<br />
  People were always getting into the wrong mode and did not know how to get back out."</p>

  <p>"even an idea that seems elegant and that satisfies some principle is not necessarily going to succeed. The only way to find out is to test it."</p>

  <p>"To make the tests of maximum benefit to the<br />
  designers, there are certain rules we try to<br />
  follow:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Don't offer help too soon;</li>

    <li>Welcome suggestions and reactions;</li>

    <li>Observe but don't pressure"</li>
  </ul>

  <p>"Even if the subject makes an obvious statement, a trivial remark, or suggests something tha% is impossible to do on a computer, it is important to welcome his reactions and discuss them as an equal."</p>

  <p>"We start out asking open questions. "Well, what do you think?" or "What was hard; what was easy?" Later we pose more direct questions like "The<br />
  time you made that certain error, what were you thinking?" or "What do you think is a better term for this concept?" Usually in the open-question stage we get some really good responses that are unexpected. The directed questions address more specific issues."</p>

  <p>"Occasionally, some user's unique quirk may be worth memtioning~ but what is of most concern is what most or all users experienced."</p>

  <p>"Some people think they can design friendly software just by being clever or by reading papers on principles of user interface design.</p>

  <p>"Design research encompasses many activities, but when deployed to develop and enhance commercial products or services it consists of studies aiming to understand the activities, desires, and needs of the people for whom a product or service is designed."</p>

  <p>"The least interesting innovations to the university and company research community are the small, slow enhancements that gradually lower costs while improving performance. But in fact, not only is this where most product enhancement takes place, but it is also where the research community can add the most value. This is where ethnographic observation can be powerful, uncovering the difficulties people have in everyday use, the workarounds and hacks they invent that can suggest product modifications. This allows existing products to be modified at low cost, low risk, while making them ever more attractive, ever more valuable to the customer base."</p>

  <p>Talk about stimulating the creativity of users, and allowing them to challenge designers, through 'design games'. They mostly point to other papers which discuss the concrete projects they did.

  <h2>Quotations</h2>

  <p>"The view that genuine user participation can be accomplished as a quick-and-dirty method, often leads to the participants being used merely as informants. Thereby the potential for innovation and creativity of the users [8], and their potential to challenge the assumptions and design ideas, stays untapped."</p>

  <p>"On one hand we have the language-game of the designers, involving concepts from the field<br />
  of design. On the other hand we have the language-game of the users and stakeholders which is grounded in their work-practice and involving concepts from their work domain. The question of communication between these two distinct practices is not a trivial one. Therefore organizing a way for designers and users to develop a common language becomes paramount for a successful design process." [discussing Ehn "Work oriented design of computer artefacts"]</p>

It is an interventionist discipline in that it aims at transforming the current state of events through the introduction of something novel.

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>Lit review, covering experimental materials supporting 'conceptual modeling' in systems analysis and design, substantiated by 'meaningful tests of domain semantics' - "research aimed at empirically evaluating ... diagrammatic notations... to convey semantics of a real world domain". They contrast 'read' tasks and 'write' tasks in experiments, and focus on 'read' tasks. They proceed to analyse prior experiments within a model of evidential quality and procedural legitimacy which they outline at the beginning of the paper.</p>

  <p>They focus on formal validity questions, e.g. controlled variables in subject selection, choice of lab versus ex-lab. Four contrasting experimental design aspects are highlighted, independent variables, <strong><em>dependent measures, participants and procedures</em></strong>.</p>

  <p>Recommend 'informational equivalence' so that the semantic delivery of different representations. They see dependent measures, such as a test of competence which combines knowledge represented with prior knowledge, to be problematic. They point out that Subject Matter Experts must not be used! (though they accept this undermines external validity) [a methodological challenge for CDPF? Does it need a modelling formalism for firmware?]. They feel that 'scripts' or representations should not be removed during assessment, as this focuses more on learning than on content transmitted, and is more externally valid. They propose an approach to obfuscate details from information, making them 'semantically void' such that prior knowledge cannot be used.</p>

  objectives of the experiment to be met. We believe there is a pressing need for more controlled<br />

  <p>"The first computer was developed by Charles Babbage. It cost more than a locomotive and did not work properly. Even though everyone tells us that computers are now "more powerful," the basic story does not seem to have changed."</p>

  <p>"It is well known that designers often design for themselves unless they have been trained to realize that people are diverse, and that users are unlikely to be like them. In computing, the design problem is exacerbated because designers, who are self-selected to be computer competent, are typically many times better at using computers than everyone else. In contrast, in any other common area of design--say, designing chairs--the designers would be unlikely to have such special and distinctive skills that marked them out as so different from everyone else. Who is so good at, say, sitting that they might underestimate how hard everyone else finds using chairs?"</p>

  <p>"domain experts can work in parallel with programmers in their respective areas of expertise; and the repeated intermingling can be automated"</p>

  <p>"Because programs are the only precise (i.e. machine processable) artifacts that record the programmers� work, any change (whether maintenance or extension) has to be done to the program, which is encoded in a way that does not clearly express the problem that was to be solved."</p>

  <p>"The goal of software is to implement a solution to a problem that is defined by human intent alone. Some people have expertise in the problem domain - they are domain experts. Some people have expertise in software creation � they are programmers. Together they create software, perhaps with some people in both roles."</p>

  <p>"For the creation of any software, two kinds of contributions need to be combined even though they are not at all similar: those of the domain providing the problem statement and those of software engineering providing the implementation. They need to be woven together to form the program."</p>

  <p>"The direct development workflow in use today (Figure 1) is the following: The domain expert communicates the problemstatement to the programmer. This is done in forms that can not be automatically transformed into code, such as specs, use cases, stories, and sketches. The programmer then weaves these intentions together with software engineering knowledge and implementation decisions and creates the source code that can run on a computer."</p>

  <p>"The domain expert need not make a decision whether the domain concept is an object, a quality, an action, a goal, or anything else. The need is just to establish an identity for it, whatever it may be, and that can be accomplished always in the same way�by a def in the schema."</p>

  <h2>Authors</h2>

  <p>Patrick Stacey</p>

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <p>Patrick uses the example of a case-study around a computer game design firm. Initially comments on the variety of established software development methodologies and their explicit or unspoken failings, around the centrality of planning. He goes on to examine the practice of software development as exercised by the case study firm in which improvisation could be said to be central, although this doesn't mean 'out of control' on Giddens definition (introduced page 17). He uses a theory of the human activity which separates aspects of Signification, Domination and Legitimation, in which Communication, Power and Sanction act through Interpretive Schemes, Resources and Rules respectively (three parallel aspects) - see diagram on Page 6. I really like the contrast between Flux and Sedimentation as it maps well to design theory, in which many alternatives are generated by some processes, and they are culled in others.</p>

  <h2>Field of Study</h2>

  <h2>Concepts</h2>

  <p>Structuration Theory, Flux and Sedimentation</p>

  <h2>Quotations</h2>

  <p>"There are many formal approaches that have been proposed for controlling software projects...the Waterfall Model (Royce, 1970) ...breaks the IS development process down into discrete stages such as feasibility study, systems investigation, and implementation (Avison and Fitzgerald, 1995). There are a number of similar structured systems development methods such as Structured Systems Analysis and Design Methodology (SSADM) (Fitzgerald, 1996) and even some forms of agile development like XP (Beck, 1999). The typical stages in the<br />
  development lifecycle occur in a linear sequential manner with a provision for feedback loops between the stages (Boehm, 1988)."</p>

  <p>"process models and other innovations such as high-level languages like object-oriented, have not improved the ability to control the software development process (Pressman, 1987); they were not �silver bullets� (Brooks, 1995)."</p>

  <p>"Therefore, there is the suggestion of letting-go in order to control when developers are seen to be capable, that they can deal with the<br />
  complexity of the situation as it emerges (Bach, 1995). This is consonant with the amethodical view of software development, which promotes embracing complexity and ambiguity. Unlike metric-driven process improvement, amethodical development emphasizes the different voices and interests of the developers, as well as negotiation that lead to compromise solutions (Truex et al, 2000:p.71)." [this is critical also to the dynamic of co-design and the general discourse around Boundary processes]</p>

  <p>"normative methodical software development approaches are employed as a social defense so as to �avoid the risks of real engagement with each other and with the task at hand. They turn away from the exigencies of work and take refuge in a surreal world.� [credited to Wastell]</p>

  <p>"Improvisation therefore carries the hallmarks of control in its potential to bring about order from chaos (e.g.Highsmith, 2002; Ciborra 1999).Yet it is largely regarded as something distinct from control and a concept that requires further research (Brown and Eisenhardt, 1995). This is not surprising as control usually infers planning, whereas improvisation does not usually involve this." [related to software requirements capture vs. co-design?]</p>

  <p>"I then used structuration theory (Giddens 1984) as a theoretical lens (Orlikowski, 2000) to guide the analysis and interpret the data."</p>

  <p>"if they did not need a feature then it was not put it in, unless there was time left over for such �bells and whistles�. Identifying what was a feature and what was a bell or a whistle was constantly being decided on-the-fly."</p>

  <p>"Despite the constant communication between client and QGS in the form of reports and art samples there was still a lack of shared understanding. They seemed to be talking past each other, not clarifying meanings but making assumptions. It was only when a playable prototype was presented to the client that an awareness of acommunication breakdown emerged."</p>

  <p>"I now draw on the three associated dimensions and related elements of Giddens� Structuration theory as a lens by which to interpret the themes of communication, power, and legitimation. I relate to communication to efforts to understand project details such as requirements and design, power relates to improvisation, and legitimation relates to norms of software development."</p>

  <p>"Legitimation could therefore lead to non-routine actions. Given the designs were construed as being ambiguous for instance, this provoked a stream of non-routine improvised activities in order to fill the �interpretive holes� in the design in-use. The communication process therefore had the potential to significantly flex the game development practices. Indeed, play-testing was a practice that enabled the clarification of the meanings of the design in-use. Therefore, while play-testing constituted a non-routine and improvised activity, its repetition simultaneously contributed to the sedimentation of the design in-use and thereby also the process as a whole"</p>

  <p>"The communication process involved intense and ingenious efforts to make sense of equivocal designs in-use. To exercise their power over or improvise around ambiguity, the actors engaged in an intense interplay between (re)interpretation and play-testing. Play-testing was the act by which the actors performed a game prototype, i.e. a manifestation or �build� of a design in-use. Sometimes this occurred as a distinct phase in the innovation process, or through the use of a design tool. The play-test performance contributed to efforts to make sense of designs in-use, stimulating interpretation and reflection"</p>

  <p>"Through ongoing design improvisation, so a collective sense of designs in-use emerged, which contributed to design sedimentation and control. It may be imagined then that design improvisation was like a vortex or spiral that inched ever closer towards sedimentation,"</p>

  <p>"The implication here is that where the requirements and design have a strong aesthetic component, improvisation may be a more salient process control strategy."</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, due to ridiculous historical circumstances, computers have been made a mystery to most of the world. And this situation does not seem to be improving. You hear more and more about computers, but to most people it�s just one big blur. The people who know about computers often seem unwilling to explain things or answer your questions. Stereotyped notions develop about computers operating in fixed ways�and so confusion increases. The chasm between laymen and computer people widens fast and dangerously. This book is a measure of desperation, so serious and abysmal is the public sense of confusion and ignorance. Anything with buttons or lights can be palmed off on the laymen as a computer. There are so many different things, and their differences are so important; yet to the lay public they are lumped together as �computer stuff,� indistinct and beyond understanding or criticism. It�s as if people couldn�t tell apart camera from exposure meter or tripod, or car from truck or tollbooth."</p>

  <p>"the use of computers is dominated by a priesthood, people who spatter you with unintelligible answers and seem unwilling to give you straight ones"</p>

  <p>"great concern and consideration has always gone into calculating the �correct� teaching sequence for each �subject.� In recent years radical new teaching sequences have been introduced for teaching various subjects, including mathematics and physics. But such efforts appear to have been misinformed by the idea of supplanting the �wrong� teaching sequence with the �right� teaching sequence, one which is �validated.�...this all ignores a simple fact: all are arbitrary. Instructional sequences aren�t needed at all if the people are motivated and the materials are clear and available... Prearranged sequences become unnecessary if the student can see what he has yet to learn, then pursue it."</p>

  <p>"Until now, the mechanical properties of external objects determined what they were to us and how we used them. But henceforth this is arbitrary.<br />
  The recognition of that arbitrariness, and reconsideration among broader and more general alternatives, awaits us."</p>

  <p>"The human mind being as supple as it is, anything whatever can be used to control systems. The problem is having it be a comprehensible whole. As already remarked, our ability mentally to unify things is extraordinary. That we somehow tie together clutch, gear, accelerator and brake into a comprehensible control structure to make cars go and stop should amaze and instruct. Engineers and �human factors� people speak as though there were some kind of scientific or determinate way to design control systems. Piffle. We choose a set of controls, much like an artist�s Palette, on the basis of general appropriateness; and <em><strong>then try best and most artistically to fit them to what needs doing</strong></em> [my italics]. The result must be conceptually clear and retroactively �obvious��simply because clarity is the simplest way to keep the user from making mistakes. Clear and simple systems are easier to learn, harder to forget, less likely to be screwed up by the user, and thus are more economical�getting more done for the resources put in."</p>

  <p>"Careless and horrible designs are not all fictitious. One egregious example also indicates the low level of design currently going into some responding systems: computer people have designed CRT writing systems for newspapers which actually have a �kill� button on the console, by which authors would accidentally kill their stories. In a recent magazine article it was explained that the eventual solution was to change the program so that to kill the story you had to hit the �kill� button twice. To me this seems like a beautiful example of what happens when you let insulated technical people design the system for you: a �kill� button on the keyboard is about as intelligent as installing knives on the dashboard of a car, pointing at the passenger."</p>

  <p>"When computer programmers or other technical people design particular systems without thinking more generally, things are not<br />
  likely to be either simple or combinable. What may result are intricate user-level controls for one particular function, controls that are differently used for another particular function, making the two functions not combinable."</p>

  <p>"any system of controls can gradually come through use to have a psychological organization, even spuriously. The trap is that we so easily<br />
  lose sight of arbitrariness and even stupidity of design, and live with it when it could be so much better, because of this psychological melding."</p>

  <p>"The fantic structure of anything, then, consists of its noticeable parts, interconnections, contents and effects. I claim that it is the fantic unity�the conceptual and presentational clarity of these things�that makes fantic systems�presentational systems and material�clear and helpful, or not."</p>

  <p>"The branching computer screen, together with the selfsame computer�s ability to turn anything else on and off as selected by the user, and to fetch up information, yields a realm of option in the design of media and environment that has never existed before."</p>

  <p>"interior computer technicalities have to be SUBSERVIENT, and the programmers cannot be allowed to dictate how it is to behave on the basis of the under level structures that are convenient to them. Quite the contrary: from the fullest consideration of the richest upper-level structures we want, we the users-to-be must dictate what lower-level structures are to be prepared within"</p>

  <p>"It is useful, by way of summary, to distinguish four reasons why it is difficult to create alternatives to the standard methods of AI. First, it is difficult to become aware of the full range of assumptions underneath existing practices, from technical methods to genre conventions to metaphors. Second, having formulated an alternative intuition, it is difficult to reduce that intuition to a novel technical method -- a new type of artifact, or a new way of building artifacts. Third, having invented a new technical method, it is difficult to prevent that method from being construed as "nothing new" within the elastic boundaries of existing technical schemata. Fourth, having coupled a new technical method with a new way of talking about the phenomena, it is difficult to apply the method to any real cases without inventing a lot of additional methods as well, since any worthwhile system will require the application of several interlocking methods, and use of the existing methods may distort the novel method back toward the traditional mechanisms and the traditional ways of talking about them. This litany of obstacles does not make critical technical practice impossible; it simply defines the terrain upon which such a practice must work."</p>
