        Gambits and Precedent: Some Factors in Design Expertise</a></h1>
    <h2>Authors</h2>
    <p>Bryan Lawson</p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Referenced as a major conceptual foundation by Dan Lockton regards his
      "Design with Intent" workshopping cards.&nbsp; They talk about design
      'gambits' drawing a parallel with chess players, who do not exhaustively
      or analytically approach a game, but instead their expertise relies on
      'experience' and 'recognition' of the board state. Similarly, they explore
      studies of conversation within an architectural practice, and descriptions
      of two-dimensional images shared&nbsp; between graphical designers,
      concluding they rely on a shared base of 'precedent' references. They note
      the dominance of story, e.g. within the architectural practice, and
      characterise forms of memory in use as being 'episodic' (narrative) rather
      than 'semantic' (theoretical/verbal?)</p>
    <p>This suggests a line of enquiry for me, that users may be taught the
      value-system (win/lose analogy with chess) and the gambits of programming
      through preparing their recognition of problem situations and possible
      solutions. This could mean they can act intelligently within the program
      design space, without necessarily being coders. They may recognise the
      structure of a failure condition without necessarily having to demonstrate
      it (needing a digitally programmed prototype). With sufficient priming in
      this space, it may be possible for domain-led program design discussion to
      be sustained by non-programmers.</p>
    <p>They draw upon the concept of affordance as a proposed organising
      principle for precedents, so that designers can match problem cases to
      possible stories or previous scenarios.</p>
    <p>They interestingly draw out this contrast of being "solution focused"
      (designerly?) versus "problem focused" (analytical?). Could this relate to
      hacking versus computer science - combining designerly strategies with
      code?)</p>

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"The paper concludes that design expertise cannot be understood by
      studying actions alone but that our research needs to concentrate on
      perception and recognition and that we will have to examine conversations
      and memories as much as drawings."</p>
    <p>"to get good data on this we need to study not just the actions,
      graphical outputs and finished designs of these designers but also the
      conversations they have with each other and their clients during their
      normal working practice"</p>
    <p>"for [high level thinking] to occur in design teams the schemata and
      gambits need to be shared to the extent that they can be named and
      communicated with simple references." - suggests a kind of test for the
      success of pedagogy to teach programming gambits to participants - can
      they use them as shared references.</p>
