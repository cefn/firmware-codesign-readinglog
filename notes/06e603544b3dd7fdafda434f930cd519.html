        for Organizing the Tools and Techniques of Participatory Design</a></h1>
    <h2>Authors</h2>
    <p>Elizabeth B.-N. Sanders, Eva Brandt and Thomas Binder</p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Made me think about upstream and downstream contributions to a
      technology, as a conceptual model for design contributions. E.g. upstream
      users, downstream developers, with some form of faithful representations
      passing along the pipeline.</p>
    <p>Their framework contrasts the following 5 interlocking concepts; <strong><em>Tools,
          Toolkits, Techniques, Methods and Approaches</em></strong>.They also
      pull out <em><strong>Form </strong></em><strong></strong>(making,
      telling, enacting)<em><strong> Purpose </strong></em><strong></strong>(why;
      for probing? for priming to a domain? to understand their experience? to
      generate new ideas?)<em><strong> and Context </strong></em><strong></strong>(group
      size, composition, face to face/online, venue)<em><strong> </strong></em>as
      key reference points. The aim is to represent various PD practices within
      a common ontology.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"There is some confusion as to which tools and techniques to use, when,
      and for what purpose. Therefore we are proposing a framework to help
      organize the proliferation of tools, techniques and methods in hopes that
      the PD community will benefit by discussing relevant applications and
      identifying potential areas for further exploration."</p>
    <p>"The main tools and techniques originating in this tradition [of
      prototyping shared artefacts] have been scenario techniques drawing on
      approaches from drama and forum theatre, design games providing materials
      and setting rules for the design dialogue and mock up and prototyping
      techniques enabling participants to jointly construct prototypes despite
      different professional backgrounds or interest in the design project."</p>
    <p>"Other traditions within participatory design have given more concern to
      how non-designers can articulate design proposals in such a way that these
      can provide a starting point for subsequent professional development
      work."</p>
