        <p>"the [design research]...community attempts to understand basic patterns of human and social behavior and how technology affects both"</p>
        <p>"we have many myths about the power of design research, brainstorming, rapid prototyping, iterative test and design, but zero evidence"</p>
        <p>"even when researchers well versed in experimental methods attempt to study practices, they discover the very nature of a practical discipline throws in so many idiosyncratic variables that rigor is simply not possible"</p>
        <p>"Pasteur...started with a real, practical problem, realized it needed some fundamental scientific advances before it could be solved, did the science, and then applied it back to the problem. In other words, the research was done in search of a solution to a real problem: what Stokes calls “use-inspired basic research.”"</p>
