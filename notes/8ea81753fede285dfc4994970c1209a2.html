        User Models for Predictive Evaluation of Interface Designs</a></h1>
    <h2>Authors</h2>
    <p>Richard M. Young, T.R.G. Green and Tony Simon</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>A PUM (programmable user model) is a boundary object for describing the
      behaviour (and state of mind) of a user in order to permit more precise
      specification of usability proposals or concerns.</p>
    <p>Contrasts with the model advocated by Alan Dix in his preamble to "Formal
      Methods for Interactive Systems" where he advocates modelling the system
      from the point of view of the user. This is very strongly about modelling
      the user.</p>

    <h2>Field of Study</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>PUM (Programmable User Model)</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Related: GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods and Selection rules Card et al),
      KLM (Keystroke Level Modelling) and Methods-Time Measurement also linked
      to this - a quality metric not unlike Thimbleby's 'time to read manual' as
      a quantitative metric.</p>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"A Programmable User Model (PUM) is a psychologically constrained
      architecture which an interface designer is invited to program to simulate
      a<br>
      user performing a range of tasks with a proposed interface. It provides a
      novel way of conveying psychological considerations to the designer, by<br>
      involving the designer in the process of making predictions of usability."</p>
    <p>"The Human Factors advisor might reply "It's a confusing design, people
      won't be able to use it". the designer will reject the judgement (because
      it is<br>
      simply the advisor's word against the designer's) and will find it
      genuinely unhelpful (because of the lack of specific diagnosis and
      guidance)"</p>
    <p>"guidelines would indicate something like: "Users can retain at most four
      items of changing information; design the interface so that they never
      need to store more...suppose... that we present the designer with a
      programmable architecture that has only four slots (say) for dynamic
      information ...Then the designer has to program the PUM respecting the
      constraint, or else the model will make errors when it runs."</p>
    <p>"Users deciding on their next action may need to gather and weigh
      evidence from a number of different sources and lines of reasoning, such
      as: previous experience with the system; remembered instructions for
      performing the current task; analogies from other tasks or everyday
      behaviour;<br>
      information on or derivable from the screen; examples in a manual; and so
      on."</p>
