      Notes
    </h2>
    <p>
      Brock was a colleague at Tinkerlondon. Reports on 'sketching' as a
      technique (see also CHI paper which places sketching as central to all
      design). A broad literature review around sketching and collaborative
      design. Worth re-reading whenever covering a section on sketching as
      boundary object within the PhD.

      Quotations

    <p>
      "Our research has uncovered some of the evidence that outlines why
      sketching is useful and why it is therefore so central to...activities
      in...design-oriented disciplines [such as] architecture, engineering, and
      visual communication"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sketching is regarded as an important part of design activity, primarily
      because it supports cognition in ways that lead to creativity"
    </p>
    <p>
      "research has provided concrete evidence for the value and mechanisms of
      sketching in three ways: by empirically demonstrating the design value of
      sketching, articulating the cognitive support it provides, and describing
      how this is useful for fostering creativity"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sketching was found to be valuable because it supports individual
      re-interpretive cycles of idea generation, and enhances individual"and
      group access to earlier ideas." [reporting on Van der Lugt]
    </p>
    <p>
      "Their work also showed that by providing an external representation with
      which team members could interact, sketching enhanced collaborative
      activities." [this is a worthwhile dimension (stimulating collaboration,
      beyond mere communication)]
    </p>
    <p>
      "In terms of creativity and cognition, two concepts recur in the
      literature: lateral transformations (i.e., lateral thinking) and cycles
      of generation and interpretation, or “dialectic”. These two concepts are
      seen as cognitive benefits which sketching provides and which foster
      activities generative of creativity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fällman [9] also describes sketching as having important cognitive
      effects because it parallels designers’ thinking processes. He sees
      sketching as ‘not primarily a tool, technique, or skill that is available
      to designers, but rather as the way in which designers think’. Because of
      this, Fällman (like Buxton), considers sketching to be archetypal of
      design."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Goel [11] identifies important distinctions between ill-structured
      problems and well-structured problems, and argues that ‘some
      ill-structured problems require “ill-structured” representations to
      prevent premature crystallization of ideas and facilitate the generation
      and exploration of alternate solutions’."
