    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"It is useful, by way of summary, to distinguish four reasons why it is
      difficult to create alternatives to the standard methods of AI. First, it
      is difficult to become aware of the full range of assumptions underneath
      existing practices, from technical methods to genre conventions to
      metaphors. Second, having formulated an alternative intuition, it is
      difficult to reduce that intuition to a novel technical method -- a new
      type of artifact, or a new way of building artifacts. Third, having
      invented a new technical method, it is difficult to prevent that method
      from being construed as "nothing new" within the elastic boundaries of
      existing technical schemata. Fourth, having coupled a new technical method
      with a new way of talking about the phenomena, it is difficult to apply
      the method to any real cases without inventing a lot of additional methods
      as well, since any worthwhile system will require the application of
      several interlocking methods, and use of the existing methods may distort
      the novel method back toward the traditional mechanisms and the
      traditional ways of talking about them. This litany of obstacles does not
      make critical technical practice impossible; it simply defines the terrain
      upon which such a practice must work."</p>
