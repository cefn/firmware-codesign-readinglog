      "In the book there are some excellent interviews with prominent
      representatives of the interaction design field. In one of those
      interviews, Gitta Salomon states that, interaction design is a design
      discipline (33)."

      "In the preface, Preece et al. define interaction design as, 'designing
      interactive products to support people in their everyday and working
      lives.'"

      "This notion of design as a plan-then-act activity fits well with the
      software engineering approach permeating most contemporary HCI,<br/>
      but perhaps not so well with design theory. Planning is rather viewed as
      performed through acting, expressing, communicating. The<br/>
      execution is the planning; the planning is the execution. Together, they
      are part of the evolution known as design. The prominent design<br/>
      theorist J.C. Jones gives the following advice: <em>First, recognize that
      the ‘right’ requirements are in principle unknowable by users, customers
      and designers at the start. Devise the design process, and the formal
      agreement between designers and customers and users, to be sensitive to
      what is<br/>
      learnt by any of the parties as the design evolves.</em>"

      "people work and live in certain ways already, and they understand how to
      adapt that within a small range, but they don’t have an understanding or
      a feel for what it would mean to make a radical change, for example, to
      change their way of doing business on the Internet before it was around,
      or to change their way of writing from pen and paper when word processors
      weren’t around...I think what the designer is trying to do is to envision
      things for users that the users can’t yet envision."
