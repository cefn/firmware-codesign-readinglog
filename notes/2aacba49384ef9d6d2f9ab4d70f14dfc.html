        <p>A convergence of the use of 'bricolage' and that of Boundary-spanning, within design teams. They are looking at the design of information systems to mesh with organisations, and use this to justify the perspective they are more complex than the design of a regular "technology artifact".<br/>

        <p>"no one design group participant is likely to understand either the problem domain or the solution domain in full"</p>
        <p>"The model builds on the notion of technological frames, to develop a theory of framing at the three levels of project coordination, group consensus-building, and individual learning and dissonance."</p>
        <p>"The term information system is used here to mean an integrated social system of organizational actors, using information to perform purposeful activity, who may or may not use computer-based technology to facilitate their work and to provide information" [citing Checkland]</p>
        <p>"Where tame (traditionally-conceived) design problems can be defined, analyzed, and decomposed to arrive at a solution, wicked problems require evolutionary design approaches, based on argumentation, emergent problem representation, and goal-negotiation across stakeholder groups"</p>
        <p>"we seek an alternative model of the design process Â– one that fits with the reframing of problems and solution-search that appears to underlie emergent knowledge processes"</p>
        <p>"similar to the concept of Â“grindingÂ” between problem and solution space (Purao et al., 2003)" [this is intriguing, as if the solution grinds the burrs off the problem, and the problem grinds the burrs off the solution. I can't access the paper, though"]</p>
        <p>"An IS design problem situation may be perceived as a wicked problem simply because of repeated breakdowns in trust between group members. Negotiating trust relationships may require methods that do not directly challenge individual assumptions and frameworks of interpretation." [suggests a medium for bricolage which both sides are familiar (or equally unfamiliar) with]<br/>
