        <p>"To resolve this apparent paradox, that some objects reinforce boundaries between functional domains, while other objects actually help actors collaborate across the boundaries between functional domains, I will outline the characteristics that allow a particular object to play the role of a boundary object. With all this done I the describe what I call a “relational” view which focuses on the relationship between the actors involved and the boundary objects that they use. This relational view addresses both the capacity of the boundary objects to represent the differences and dependencies that are consequential (Carlile, 2003) between them, but also an actors ability (Black, Carlile and Repenning, 2003) to wield those boundary objects as they seek to represent and even negotiate the knowledge being used to define the product."</p>
