        <p>
      Norman argues that all significant innovations have taken place driven by
      technology, and not delivered by the nuances of user-driven activities or
      design-research "Technology First, Needs Last".Â 
    </p>
        <p>
      His observation that design research should focus more on incremental
      change is essentially what Firmware co-design is about.

      "Most innovations are small, relatively simple, and fit comfortably into
      the established rhythm and competencies of the existing
      product-delivery<br/>
      cycle. Moreover, it is these small, incremental improvements that are
      best informed by design research."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Design research encompasses many activities, but when deployed to
      develop and enhance commercial products or services it consists of
      studies aiming to understand the activities, desires, and needs of the
      people for whom a product or service is designed."
    </p>
        <p>
      "The least interesting innovations to the university and company research
      community are the small, slow enhancements that gradually lower costs
      while improving performance. But in fact, not only is this where most
      product enhancement takes place, but it is also where the research
      community can add the most value. This is where ethnographic observation
      can be powerful, uncovering the difficulties people have in everyday use,
      the workarounds and hacks they invent that can suggest product
      modifications. This allows existing products to be modified at low cost,
      low risk, while making them ever more attractive, ever more valuable to
      the customer base."
