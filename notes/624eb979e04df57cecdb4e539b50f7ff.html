      Rosas [concerning the Gambiarra]</p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Although more media-centric as a volume, the one paper on Gambiarra is
      very relevant to the notion of bricolage.</p>
    <h2>Field of Study</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>Gambiarra</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"The Gambiarra: Considerations on a Recombinatory Technology"</p>
    <p>"gambiarra also means something far more akin to the English term
      makeshift, referring to any improvisation of an expedient substitute when
      other means fail or are not available. In other words, 'making do.'"</p>
    <p>"The gambiarra also comes very close to the concept of bricolage
      formulated by Claude Lévi-Strauss in The Savage Mind. Considering the
      bricoleur as “he who works with his hands, but using indirect means, if
      compared with the artist,” 4 his materials are not definable in terms of a
      project, like those of the engineer, but merely by their instrumentality
      as items collected and stored because they “might come in handy.” The
      bricoleur creates in the absence of a preconceived plan, removed from all
      standard technical processes and norms, using only fragmentary, readymade
      materials; and his creations always come to a new arrangement of elements
      the natures of which are only modified by the manner in which they feature
      in the instrumental assemblage or the final structure. The distinction
      Lévi-Strauss draws between the bricoleur and the engineer is essential to
      understanding the gambiarra, this freewheeling creation that goes beyond
      user manuals and projectual restrictions, being essentially a practice of
      bricolage."</p>
