        <p>Although more media-centric as a volume, the one paper on Gambiarra is very relevant to the notion of bricolage.</p>

        <p>"The Gambiarra: Considerations on a Recombinatory Technology"</p>
        <p>"gambiarra also means something far more akin to the English term makeshift, referring to any improvisation of an expedient substitute when other means fail or are not available. In other words, 'making do.'"</p>
        <p>"The gambiarra also comes very close to the concept of bricolage formulated by Claude Lévi-Strauss in The Savage Mind. Considering the bricoleur as “he who works with his hands, but using indirect means, if compared with the artist,” 4 his materials are not definable in terms of a project, like those of the engineer, but merely by their instrumentality as items collected and stored because they “might come in handy.” The bricoleur creates in the absence of a preconceived plan, removed from all standard technical processes and norms, using only fragmentary, readymade materials; and his creations always come to a new arrangement of elements the natures of which are only modified by the manner in which they feature in the instrumental assemblage or the final structure. The distinction Lévi-Strauss draws between the bricoleur and the engineer is essential to understanding the gambiarra, this freewheeling creation that goes beyond user manuals and projectual restrictions, being essentially a practice of bricolage."</p>
