        <p>"The visually evident design object for software are their user interfaces (Löwgren &amp; Stolterman, 2005; Hallnäs &amp; Redström 2002), although there are other form factors and design objects, such as packaging, installation procedures, remote controls, licensing procedures, support and after market services, functionality and construction of algorithms, innovation and architectural aspects. For most software products, though, the design of the software is manifested through the usage of it (Holmlid, 2002, 2005; Bannon &amp; Bödker 1991), which in turn can be viewed as being mediated by its interface. At some point during system development the user interface will be programmed, just as the rest of the system."</p>
        <p>"For Loop and Hip programming is viewed as purely construction work. Basically this means that setting up a software development centre is similar to setting up an assembly factory, or acquiring production capacity for a component. The provisions for enabling component based software development is that the software can be modularized in components, that there is an architecture that defines the assembly of the components, and that there is an assembly process that directs the requirements for the development of components. This perspective resembles a traditional production-process perspective. With the position IxD argues for, that the design material is not like traditional industrial design material, the production-process perspective would not be accepted without good arguments."</p>
        <p>"if design decisions have not been made before programming time, these decisions will be made during programming time. This does not imply that programmers should be excluded from making such decisions; rather it implies that we need to have an interaction design strategy and direct design work."</p>
        <p>"some companies have succeeded with approaches such as; guidelines, programming design tools, design reviews, critique systems, design patterns, templates etc. They highlight the fact that the interaction design work of systems can not be dis-integrated from the development of the rest of the software product."</p>
        <p>"From software engineering perspectives, and thus with a focus on construction quality, there have been employed a varied set of methods, such as verification driven development, integration driven development, and feature based development, although<br/>there is little said about design management aspects within these"</p>
