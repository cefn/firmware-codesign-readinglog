        <p>"A useful definition is also provided by Kleinsmann and Valkenburg, who described co-design as ‘the process in which actors from different disciplines share their knowledge about both the design process and the design content ... in order to create shared understanding on both aspects ... and to achieve the larger common objective: the new product to be designed’"</p>
        <p>"What happens in (co-)design can be understood more adequately as a process of abduction—a term coined by pragmatist philosopher C.S. Peirce, which refers to a type of reasoning that is different from deduction or induction: ‘deduction proves that something must be; induction shows that something actually is operative; abduction merely suggests that something may be.’"</p>
        <p>"In design thinking, problems and possible solutions are explored and developed and evaluated simultaneously in an iterative process:"</p>
        <p>"Dewey distinguished between primary experiences of ‘gross, macroscopic, crude subject-matters’, that is, experiences ‘as the result of a minimum of incidental<br/>reflection’, and secondary experiences of ‘refined, derived objects of reflection’, that is, experiences ‘in consequence of continued and regulated reflective inquiry’. Furthermore, Dewey promoted an ‘empirical method’ of moving back and forth between practices (primary experiences) and reflections (secondary experiences) in order to develop practical knowledge: knowledge that is based on practices and that is practically applicable."</p>
