        construction of fictional space in participatory design practice<br>
      </a></h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>They look at the design of museum spaces and experiences as a PD process,
      then step back to analyse the results to understand the 'fictional spaces'
      which exist within creative workshops, as people imagine things which
      don't yet exist, and step away from the confines of reality.</p>
    <p>Emphasis on the space metaphor, and the problem transformations which
      designers do to recast these 'spaces' conceptually. They relate this to
      literary fictions, and measures of realism which are used in that parallel
      domain.</p>
    <p>In their case studies, they use 'obstructions' in a design brief as props
      to "mandate particular forms of imagining". However, they use these
      examples to pursue a more philosophical examination of fiction, as
      suggested by...</p>
    <p>"the [fictional space] perspective enables reflection on three aspects of
      design inquiries. First, it provides concepts for reflecting on how design
      inquiries are staged in terms of the props chosen and how these are
      intended to promote particular avenues for participants to pursue. Second,
      the perspective provides concepts for reflection in action as design
      inquiries unfold by highlighting the dynamic processes in which fictional
      truths are created and negotiated among participants. Third, the
      perspective provides means for reflecting on the outcomes of design
      inquiries in terms of understanding how participants create new
      constellations by conflating elements from existing practices with novel
      conceptions."</p>

    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"With inspiration from literary theory, it is argued that the production
      of fictional space may be understood in terms of participants practicing
      games of make-believe mediated by props."</p>
    <p>"Common to these approaches and to PD in general is an emphasis on
      designing with users as a situated phenomenon; a practice that takes place
      in particular settings, with particular people, and under particular
      circumstances and that these fundamentally shape what is envisioned and
      designed in the cooperation between designers and users" - relates to
      workshopping with Paraglider pilots in Manteigas.</p>
    <p>"what is given from the outset, however vague or ill-defined, is changed
      through the process. Design is thus always design of something given, but
      what that given is depends on what is designed. From a rational point of
      view, this state of affairs seems at best circular, at worst logically
      paradoxical." - discusses what is interesting about "design briefing" and
      the renegotiation of the problem itself (probably from within an assumed
      value system underlying the original request).</p>
    <p>"props may serve to coordinate imagination among participants. What is
      imagined and how the fictional space develops has both aspects of people
      enacting what is afforded by the materials provided (props) and people
      bringing to the table novel insights or perhaps changing the very
      structure of the fictional truths that make up the fictional space. "</p>

    <p>Greenbaum and Kyng (1991) again credited for introducing participatory
      design.</p>
    <p>Ehn (1988) conceptualising PD "as a mutual learning process where
      designers step into the world of use and users learn about the
      opportunities offered by technology" and for his "assertion that design is
      always caught in the tension between tradition and transcendence; between
      what already exists and what could exist in the future" and that the
      "effect of alienation/distancing) may serve to highlight untried
      possibilities as it ‘re-casts’ what is already known in a new light"</p>
    <p>"Donald Schon [(1987)] showed how design develops as fluctuations between
      problem setting and problem solving...an alternative to Herbert Simon’s
      (1969) idea of design as a ‘science of the artificial’</p>
    <p>Rittel and Weber (1973) wicked problems paper is credited.</p>
    <p>Malmgren (1985) delivers a key thrust to their analysis - describing
      fictional worlds in novels according to alienation 'distance' or angle of
      departure. Malmgren's "point, that fictional spaces most often draw on
      non-fictional elements and that they in fact intersect. Fictional spaces
      may be to a large extent autonomous, but they maintain links to
      non-fiction."</p>
    <p>Walton (1990) outlines three roles props can have for creative thought,
      as prompts of creativity, as actual objects of the creative input or as a
      means to deliver a fictional truth</p>
    <p>Muller (2003) "has provided a comprehensive account of the parameters,
      practices<br>
      and props used in terms of creating hybridity in PD work...the in-between
      regions that share attributes of both users’ and designers’ space leading
      to new interpretations and ideas" - this is a re-definition of boundary
      objects isn't it?</p>
