    <h2>Notes&nbsp;</h2>
    <p>This paper studies the ways in which knitwear designers characterise
      "static locations in design space" for the manufacturing and other
      functions to engage with. Reference to inspirations and sources seems to
      be vital, essentially substituting for anything else. Suggests a valuable
      additional dimension to boundary object design.</p>

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"In a study of knitwear design, a process in which the use of sources of
      inspiration is explicitly acknowledged, we have observed that designers
      communicate with each other about new designs, styles and moods, largely
      by reference to the sources of their ideas."</p>
    <p>"Their words can only be understood correctly by people who know what the
      sources of their design ideas are."</p>
    <p>"narrower terms for specific uses of idea sources in design: <em><strong>starting<br>
          design</strong></em>—the design that is modified to generate a new
      design; <em><strong>precedent</strong></em>—<br>
      in architecture a culturally approved building that lends authority to new<br>
      designs based on it 8 ; <em><strong>reuse</strong></em>—the deployment of
      an existing component in<br>
      a new context; <em><strong>pattern</strong></em>—the manifestation of a
      solution principle ; and<br>
      primary generator—a salient and explicit feature of the problem which<br>
      shapes the design"</p>
    <p>"Sources of inspiration play a number of important roles in design
      thinking, as definitions of context, triggers for idea generation, and as
      anchors for structuring designers’ mental representations of<br>
      designs."</p>
    <p>"Schon characterises design as an interactive conversation between mind
      and sketch. Designers directly appreci-<br>
      ate different types of information in their own sketches, alternating
      between seeing that and seeing as"</p>
    <p>"In communication within the knitwear design process, moods and styles<br>
      are normally expressed on boards. All the information is shown concur-<br>
      rently, in contrast to the sequential nature of verbal descriptions."</p>
    <p>"Many design domains...do not have a universal standard vocabulary for
      variations of design elements...Therefore only a direct reference to an
      example can communicate the design element unambiguously...designers make
      do with informal vocabulary that is open to misinterpretation. Reference
      to examples is more concise and precise than alternative descriptions.
      Words can be used like images to evoke the connotations of designs and
      styles rather than describe them."</p>
    <p>"Sources of inspiration provide designers with a vocabulary for thinking
      about designs and communicating their ideas to others."</p>
    <p>"they describe static locations in design space, rather than trajectories
      through it. Their use of source-language contained no verbs."</p>
    <p>"Sources of inspiration function similarly to sketches, as (1)
      facilitators of reinterpretation when the context has changed, and (2) as
      memory aids." £ suggests another analogy to draw upon for firmware
      blueprints."</p>
    <p>"The work of design teams depends on communicating designs to colleagues
      who have different concerns, expertise, mental representations of the
      designs, and frames of reference, but who share the same objectives.
      Unless accurate and unambiguous communication methods are available, such
      as precise technical specifications, design ideas are interpreted using
      contextual knowledge. Therefore it is important to share the sources,
      which act as referents."</p>
    <p>"Helicopter engineers talk about their designs with<br>
      reference to previous versions that have particular modification clusters
      to<br>
      meet particular requirements, describing how they might be further modi-<br>
      fied. A description in terms of basic geometric and functional parameters<br>
      would be too unwieldy to use in conceptual design, and make premature<br>
      commitments to detailed decisions, when the characteristics designers need<br>
      to think about are distantly removed from such terms."</p>
    <p>"Our observations indicate that<br>
      the effect of complexity is very similar to the effect of aesthetics in
      making<br>
      the relationship between structural elements and the features and
      behaviour<br>
      that emerge from their interaction subtle enough to force designers to
      resort<br>
      to subjective judgement and argumentation, as well as example-driven<br>
      thinking, when they need to think directly about interactions and emergent<br>
      global features."</p>
    <p>"Communication by reference to other designs and other sources of design
      elements is a powerful way to express complex ideas quickly, because the
      new design inherits both details and context from the object of
      inspiration."</p>
    <p>Communication by reference to previous designs and other sources is a
      feature of situations like the conceptual<br>
      design of helicopters, where designers think in terms of coherent feature<br>
      clusters and emergent properties rather than individual parameters and<br>
      structural elements."</p>
