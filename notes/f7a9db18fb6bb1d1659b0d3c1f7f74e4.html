      "The original notion of<br />
      design patterns stems from Christopher Alexanderâ€™s<br />
      notion of pattern languages for Architecture [2]. A key<br />
      perspective of this work was the dual utility of patterns<br />
      serving as a common vocabulary by which people can<br />
      succinctly communicate well-known solutions to<br />
      recurring problems and a systematic language for<br />
      developing holistic solutions by composing patterns at<br />
      different levels of abstraction. Patterns are used to<br />
      leverage the experience of system designers and<br />
      capture not only descriptions of solutions to recurring<br />
      problems, but also the context addressed by the<br />
      solutions, the means by which problem requirements<br />
      are satisfied and examples of the solution"
