      Notes
    </h2>
    <p>
      I have a suspicion that the (mainstream field) of Service Design could
      have a lot in common with Firmware from the point of view of having
      difficulties materialising the field of work. That is to say, the
      holistic asynchronous flow of events which combine together to deliver a
      service are equally hard to concretise, although we would expect users to
      be able to describe parts accurately, drawing on their common sense, in a
      way which is perhaps impossible with firmware, because humans can be
      deployed to deliver the service.

      "The design of a system can be considered as a user-centred design only
      if it meets the aims, requirements and mental models of users."
