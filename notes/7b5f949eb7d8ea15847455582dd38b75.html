            <p>A paper on this theme, authored by Bill Gaver, was proposed by Liz Edwards as a counterpoint to Zimmerman's rejection of Research through Design in commercial contexts.</p>

        <p>
            <div>our team was involved in a project designing for older people living in a care home</div>
        </p>
        <p>we developed a trolley called the Photostroller that shows a continuous slideshow of photographs scraped from the Web, using a controller that enables users to select from a set of predefined categories and tune the degree of “semantic drift” between successive images</p>
        <p>
            <div>Later, when the field trial was over, we wrote a report of the project...we could have theo-</div>
            <div>rized the Photostroller in any number of different ways...Any of these themes could have been abstracted, conceptualized, theorized. Instead, what we highlighted reflected our own views, not only about what was salient for the Photostroller, but also about what is topical and important for research in interaction design....But our theorizing was underdetermined by design—we could have developed any number of theories that would have fit our design. Moreover, our theorizing was, in a sense, political....[it] didn’t just concern what is, but what ought to be</div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <div>Do we need to add some special ingredient—predefined research questions, perhaps, or methodological rigor, or the production of theory—to design practice in order for it to count as research? Or do we have to go further, and change design practices</div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <div>Methodologies and theories may well produce respectable research, but the danger is that this will come at the expense of design.</div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <div>build[ing] upon practices already in use ...would allow designers to legitimate their activities as research, not by changing their practices to resemble those of other fields, but by more careful articulation of their existing approaches in a way that is legible to those from other disciplines</div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <div>In particular, we suggest that annotated portfolios provide a way to present the fruits of design that</div>
            <div>simultaneously respect the particularity and multidimensionality of design work while meeting many of the demands of generalizable theory.</div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <div>A myriad of choices go into the design of any given artifact. These choices are varied, multifaceted, and heterogeneous.</div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <div>as designers we typically comment on the artifacts we build to highlight the concerns and</div>
            <div>choices made in their development. This happens routinely both in commercial and research settings.</div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <div>written accounts can at best be partial views onto the design as a whole, focusing on some concerns at the expense of others</div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <div>Much of our knowledge of making is tacit. As such, it need not appear in written texts because we assume it is shared by members of the community</div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <div>textual accounts in design research have an indexical character..., they point to features of our designs and connect them to matters of further concern</div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <div>we see textual accounts of artifacts...as annotations...aspects of that artifact are highlighted and linked to the concerns of a community by the text.</div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <div>designs need to be annotated if they are to make clear and accountable contributions to research</div>
