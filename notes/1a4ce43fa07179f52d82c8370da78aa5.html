        Bricolage: Anthropology Meets Design Thinking</a></h1>
    <h2>Authors</h2>
    <p>Panagiotis Louridas</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>They are from UMIST&nbsp; "Information Systems Engineer Group" and
      present design as a process of bricolage - loosely, coping with an
      established inventory of materials to address a problem. They draw on the
      definition of bricolage offered by anthropologist Levi Strauss.</p>
    <p>The notion of the bricoleur's materials being signs (as opposed to the
      objects of the engineer or the concepts of the scientist, and somewhere in
      between them) offers an exciting model which allows materials the dual
      role of <strong><em>fabric</em></strong> <em>and</em> <strong><em>representation</em></strong>.
      A bricoleur is perhaps simply an alternative word for a <em>technologist</em>
      on this model.</p>
    <p>The paper as a whole ranges over art, design, engineering, science and
      human study - quite a <em>tour de force</em>.</p>
    <p>Unselfconscious design is a valuable notion - suggesting primitive
      'design' before professionalisation of the activity.<br>

    <h2>Field of Study</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>Bricolage, selfconscious design, unselfconscious design, structure and
      events, occasion execution and purpose</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"design in all its guises is a form of bricolage"</p>
    <p>"the bricoleur makes do with what’s there, with what he encounters"</p>
    <p>"the engineer and the scientist seek to go beyond the constraints,
      pertaining to a certain state of knowledge, presented to them, whereas the
      bricoleur stays within them. The engineer and the scientist break down,
      decompose and analyse; the bricoleur reorganises. The engineer and the
      scientist abstract: they create and use concepts; the bricoleur uses
      signs."</p>
    <p>"This bricoleur’s dialog with his materials and his work continues
      throughout the process, since his decisions to use something for a
      specific purpose have consequences that he cannot foresee... ...The
      bricoleur will interrogate, use, take stock, and interrogate again."</p>
    <p>"Bricolage is therefore at the mercy of contingencies, either external,
      in the form of influences, constraints, and adversities of the external
      world, or internal, in the form of the creator’s idiosyncrasy. This"</p>
    <p>"Unselfconscious design is design without designers. It is the prevalent
      form of design activity in primitive and traditional societies, in which
      design professions do not exist. Artefacts are usually manufactured and
      designed by their prospective users. Houses are designed and built by
      their inhabitants, and not by architects."</p>
    <p>"The unselfconscious designer does not conceive and does not procure new
      tools and materials for his project. The universe of the means under his
      disposal is closed and his rule of the game is to always make do with
      ‘what’s available’. He must determine which of his tools and materials are
      suitable for his purpose; he searches his inventory and chooses among the
      possible answers. He does not decompose the problem: his purpose is not to
      examine it analytically; he reorganises his materials to create the
      structure of the envisaged artefact."</p>
    <p>"the designer selects the materials from what he sees around him; it is
      tradition that determines what he sees" [very relevant to boundary object
      'selection' or 'design' - can we offer users material which they will <em><strong>see</strong></em>
      as ready-to-hand]</p>
    <p>"a designer has to integrate three kinds of events: events pertaining to
      the occasion, to the execution and to the purpose"</p>
    <p>"Unselfconscious design is design without designers, but its designs
      surpass the capabilities of many present-day professionals. The paradox is
      explained if we think that, whereas tradition limits the designer’s
      choice, and therefore limits the demands placed on him, the present-day
      designer does not have this aide...In a sense, tradition designs through
      the unselfconscious designer." [deeply relevant to choice of boundary
      objects in workshops - how do we embed 'good design' in what is offered?]</p>
    <p>"In selfconscious design tradition no longer filters occasion, execution,
      and purpose contingencies. The designer is free to resolve them and use
      them in appropriate ways. In fact, he is not only free to resolve them, he
      is also responsible to resolve them and use them in appropriate ways. Some
      innocence is lost...."</p>
    <p>"It is...imperative to find ways to handle design complexity.
      Design-by-drawing is such a way...and it is the most distinguishing
      characteristic of selfconscious design..."</p>
    <p>"The designer’s freedom and his use of diagrams set the scene for
      self-conscious design. Both of them seem to contradict the notion of
      design as bricolage: the designer’s freedom contradicts the bricoleur’s
      making do with what’s available; the designer’s use of diagrams
      contradicts the bricoleur’s immediate handling of the object of his work.
      However...[d]esign in its selfconscious guise is still a<br>
      form of bricolage...Once the designer has created his inventory, once he
      has decided on how to work and with what to work, the universe of his
      tools and materials is closed and he has to design with them."</p>
    <p>"Selfconscious design...proceeds by using analogies of the envisaged
      artefact. It uses models that are like it in some special way. Its power
      derives exactly from the power of these models. The designer can handle
      the models in ways that he could never handle the artefact. In fact, the
      designer works in the same way, but at a different level."</p>
    <p>"In literal design (i.e., unselfconscious design), the structure is the
      finished artefact. In metaphorical design (i.e., selfconscious design),
      the structure is a model of the finished artefact" [critical philosophical
      perspective for workshop design]</p>
    <p>"in a nutshell, science is concerned with discovering facts about the
      world, while design is concerned with changing the world"</p>
    <p>"It has been shown that scientists attack a problem by trying to discover
      the rule governing the situation; designers attack a problem by proposing
      solutions and reflecting on the discrepancies with the desired result;
      scientists work analytically, designers work synthetically."</p>
    <p>"Design is a tinkering using materials which the designer cannot freely
      select, and which have meanings which he cannot freely specify, in order
      to make a structure fitting the structure of the context."</p>
    <p>"The designer, like the bricoleur, does not only speak with his work, he
      also speaks through his work. There is always a personal element in
      design; and for design to be successful, the designer must recognise that
      and pour himself into the process. Design is not just a process; it is an
      affective process. The designer must make his materials disclose
      themselves; but he must also disclose himself through the design. If
      design is not affective, we do not have design any more: we have results.
      Design is this result that does something more than simply solve the
      problem; it is the result that carries some part of the designer in it." <em>[suggests
        that the choice of inventory offered up in a workshop must accommodate
        personality, be respectful or resonant with domain users' affect]</em></p>
    <p>"this jump of faith that by putting himself in a situation the designer
      will create something out of it, the letting go and the immersion, that
      the designer must accept," <em>[suggests that users expectations and
        fears would have to be managed very closely as part of the workshop
        design, to elicit engagement]</em></p>
