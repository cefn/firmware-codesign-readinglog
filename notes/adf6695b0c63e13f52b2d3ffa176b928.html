        <h2>Authors</h2>
        <p>Kees Dorst</p>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>A critique of design research, especially prescription for design processes. Contrasts design research and design practice and tries to understand the distance between them. Urges that design processes may need to match content, personalities and context.<br/>They add 'naive' to the sequence of increasing expertise offered by Dreyfus; novice, advanced beginner, competent, expert, master, visionary.<br/>

        <p>Positions design research as the study and innovation of design practice.</p>
        <h2>Quotations</h2>
        <p>"to describe an area of complex creative<br/>human endeavour like design...one would need to describe the<em>
                <strong>object</strong>
            </em>of<br/>this activity (in this case, the design problem<br/>and the emerging design solution e the ‘con-<br/>tent’), the<em>
                <strong>actor</strong>
            </em>(the designer or the design<br/>team/designing organisation), the<em>
                <strong>context</strong>
            </em>in<br/>which the activity takes place (as far as it impacts<br/>upon the activity) and the structure and dynam-<br/>ics of the complex of activities that is being stud-<br/>ied (‘the<em>
                <strong>design process</strong>
            </em>’)."</p>
        <p>"Within design research there are two fundamen-<br/>tally different ways of looking at design process,<br/>those of rational problem solving (a goal-<br/>oriented problem solving process) and reflective<br/>practice (a process of learning)."</p>
        <p>"this total ignoring of<br/>the design content, the designer and the design<br/>context allows us to claim that we are construct-<br/>ing models, methods and tools that will be valid<br/>for every designer, dealing with every possible<br/>kind of design problem, in any situation."</p>
        <p>"Hubert Dreyfus...distinguishes six distinct<br/>levels of expertise, corresponding with six ways<br/>of perceiving, interpreting, structuring, and solv-<br/>ing problems"</p>
        <p>"Design researchers should<br/>join design practitioners in co-creating the design<br/>expertise and design practices of the future."<br/>
