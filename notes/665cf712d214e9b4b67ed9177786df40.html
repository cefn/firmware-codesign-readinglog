    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Covers their <em>future laboratories, in-situ prototyping</em>and <em>bricolage.</em>
      Focus; grounding imagination within interdisciplinary participatory
      design. They bring in Heidegger and Gibson (1986) 'jobs-at-hand' with
      means and environments as points of a methodological triangle. Their focus

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>The three methods described and exemplified above make up the<br>
      core of methods used within the WorkSpace project. In this paper<br>
      we have used triangulation as a tool to differentiate and evaluate<br>
      them. They each come into their own through combination:<br>
      approaching design challenges from various foci at different<br>
      stages of development.</p>
