      Covers their <em>future laboratories, in-situ prototyping</em> and
      <em>bricolage.</em> Focus; grounding imagination within interdisciplinary
      participatory design. They bring in Heidegger and Gibson (1986)
      'jobs-at-hand' with means and environments as points of a methodological
      triangle. Their focus - landscape architects.

      The three methods described and exemplified above make up the<br />
      core of methods used within the WorkSpace project. In this paper<br />
      we have used triangulation as a tool to differentiate and evaluate<br />
      them. They each come into their own through combination:<br />
      approaching design challenges from various foci at different<br />
      stages of development.
