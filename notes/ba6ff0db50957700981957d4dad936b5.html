        <p>"Practicing Test Driven Development is much more about setting concrete, detailed expectations in advance, and allowing those expectations of code behavior to guide the implementation than it is about testing."</p>
        <p>"In ATDD, the team creates one or more acceptance-level tests for a feature before beginning work on it. Typically these tests are discussed and captured when the team is working with the business stakeholder(s) 1 to understand a story on the backlog.</p>
