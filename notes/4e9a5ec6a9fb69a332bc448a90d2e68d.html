        <p>Models the cognitive processes involved at the divergent phase of a design process, which the authors characterise as 'sketchy' and linked to exploring multiple possibilities. They adopt the perspective of design as 'moves' in a space or game and have a corresponding analysis of transcript data. There is detailed discussion of methodology choice and self-critique of their think-aloud protocol.</p>
        <h2>Quotations</h2>
        <p>"The present study<br/>focuses on design reasoning at the early, "front edge" phase of<br/>designing in which a solution to a design problem is sought at a<br/>preliminary, sketchy level. In this phase, designers are engaged in a<br/>search in which many ideas and possibilities are typically raised<br/>and examined, often to be discarded later."</p>
        <p>"The present study investigates the<br/>relationship-assuming there is one-between contents and structure<br/>in design reasoning. By contents, we mean the context-bound subject<br/>matters that are being considered, such as rooms and walls in the<br/>case of architectural design, or metal tubes and plastic casings in the<br/>case of industrial design. By structure, we mean consistent internal<br/>relationships and patterns that can be detected in the cognitive<br/>operations involved in design thinking."</p>
        <p>"We propose an investigation<br/>of online records of design behavior, parsed into individual design<br/>moves."</p>
        <p>"In design as in other fields, most protocol analysis studies<br/>are based on "think aloud" experiments in which individuals<br/>engage in the investigated activity while they continuously verbalize their thoughts."</p>
        <p>"Linkography calls for the division of a protocol into units (by<br/>subject matter), which are then parsed into design moves. Typically,<br/>a unit comprises between twenty and one hundred moves. A move<br/>can be comprehended as follows: "The meaning of "move" in<br/>designing is akin to its meaning in chess: a design move is a step, an<br/>act, an operation, which transforms the design situation relative to<br/>the state in which it was prior to that move."</p>
        <p>"We focus our attention on the links that moves form among<br/>themselves, because we postulate that they are the key to the under-<br/>standing of design reasoning."</p>
        <p>"the intricate process of design reason-<br/>ing is nonlinear, in the sense that, at least as far as significant (criti-<br/>cal) design moves are concerned, every step is double speared: it<br/>moves forward but also makes sure that it is congruous with what<br/>has already been achieved, and it validates what has been done thus<br/>far with an eye on ways to proceed from that point"</p>
