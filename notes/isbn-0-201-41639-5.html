        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>Explores the notion of total design - practiced in the real world, as opposed to partial design - the normal way people encounter design when they are being taught it. The book rests on the notion that without specific interventions, people's partial design training will lead to problematic design outcomes. The book presents a very commercially-oriented model of design, with a strong emphasis on 'engineering' through to sales. It has an unreconstructed view of information flow forward in the product design process, (though this may be a result of an acknowledged view of the product design in hindsight). It uses concrete examples of 'total design' such as a lifting truck, a wind tunnel, surgical robotics. The 'waterfall' forward design approach is illustrated well by the conceptual diagrams (e.g. Figure 2.2 p 32 - outlines a set of sources proceeding to a formal 'product design specification', figure 2.9 p43 shows information flow from specification to sales, but not back again). A set of formal analysis approaches are proposed;<em>
                <strong>Parametric analysis</strong>
            </em>- a way in which product design spaces can be plotted parametrically to identify opportunities or outliers with respect to existing competitors.<em>
                <strong>Needs analysis</strong>
            </em>is about gathering evidence of customer need.<em>
                <strong>Matrix analysis</strong>
            </em>is a tickbox representation of competitors' products' features.</p>
        <p>In summary 'total design' adds up to not-getting-it-wrong and doesn't seem to have another definition, apart from perhaps taking the series of proposed approaches by Pugh and simply executing all of them in sequence.</p>

        <h2>Quotations</h2>
        <p>"misdirected engineering rigour will<em>
                <strong>always</strong>
            </em>gie rise to bad total design. This implies that design teams should always include non-engineers....Participants should be able to see how their differing partial design contributions fit into the whole scene. This is not a desirable objective; it is considered to be essential."</p>
        <p>"an analysis of any existing product will reveal that the main design flow is from market (user need) to sales...this activity will be referred to as the 'design core'.</p>
        <p>"Needs analysis is concerned with establishing the true needs of the customer, the 'voice of the customer'. This can be obtained by extensive examination of the views and reports of representative bodies, market data publications, (buying habits), reports giving official opinions and reactions to products in use and also by structured interviews of customer questionnaires."</p>
        <p>"random approaches to ascertain customer needs...tend to leave fundamental gaps...particularly if the questions themselves are derived and driven from consideration of existing products and customers' views of those products rather than from fundamental needs issues."</p>
        <p>"a PDS [Product Design Specification] must be comprehensive and unambiguous. If an experienced designer is asked to design something with a less than comprehensive [specification], he will almost, without thinking, fill in the gaps based on his experience and feelings; if these happen to be at variance with the true user needs, he will be designing to the wrong base."</p>
        <p>"The appearance of a product is a difficult thing to specify and therefore, in many instances, it is left to the designer; the complaints come afterward" -<em>
                <strong>analogy here with CDPF, assume it will be sorted by the firmware engineer.</strong>
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>"[product liability] legislation considers 'product defect' as its primary basis [but] many defects are designed into a product through lack of adequate consideration of all the constraints at the outset."<em>
                <strong>he proposes the term 'defect of specification' for such designed-in problems."</strong>
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>"Systematic design is essential at all levels"-<em>
                <strong>characterises well what he owes to Simon in his understanding of design, contra participatory design and divergent/convergent practices associated with design thinking.</strong>
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>"[the] tendency to 'cut and run', and start engineering and developing the ideas further...should be avoided at all costs"<em>
                <strong>doesn't seem to take account of prototyping as a productive concept-generation or confirmation design activity, even though he goes on to say...</strong>
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>"you need as many ideas as you can possibly generate - single solutions are usually a disaster."</p>
        <p>"design is not an excuse for trying to do impossible things outside the laws of physics"<em>
                <strong>an interesting parallel concern to those who might specify behaviour without recognising its computational impossibility</strong>
            </em>
