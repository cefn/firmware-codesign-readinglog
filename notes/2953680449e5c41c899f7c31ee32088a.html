        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>They examine the way in which systems will turn out differently depending on the methodological and theoretical underpinnings of the software development practice. They tell two real-world stories, and then generalise to four archetypes of development, with the final archetype being an idealistic model (from their point of view), but the main thrust being that there are various forms of 'ideal', but being reflexive about it is important.</p>
        <p>There is a clear statement, with reference to the Typesetting case study, that prototyping technologies were considered to be too inflexible to be able to represent possible software designs, and physical mockups were preferable.</p>
        <p>Does this suggest that our approach in Firmware Co-Design is 'neo-humanist' on the 'Boston Matrix' model of Burrell and Morgan - Subjectivist/Conflict quadrant?</p>
        <p>Is the Firmware Co-design approach 'analyst-as-facilitator'?</p>

        <p>"All systems developers approach the development task with a number of explicit and implicit assumptions about the nature of human organizations, the nature of the design task, and what is expected of them. This article will examine the kinds of implicit assumptions made during systems development."</p>
        <p>"we wish to show (1) that although there is a strong, orthodox approach to systems development, there are recently developed alternatives that are based on fundamentally different sets of assumptions; (2) that these assumptions primarily deal with the attitudes adopted toward reality and how to obtain knowledge about it; (3) that these assumptions are either explicitly or implicitly made in adopting a particular development approach: (4) that the ways in which system objectives are legitimized are directly related to the development approach adopted; and (5) that important social consequences result from applying a particular systems development approach."</p>
        <p>"The typesetters were interested in retaining the quality of typesetting and possibly enhancing their own productivity. To retain quality, systems design options focused on providing the flexibility and diversity of the traditional tools of the typesetting trade by electronic<br/>means. To meet this objective, the team found it necessary to use hardware mock-ups to overcome the limitations of the then-available technology. While similar to prototyping, the hardware mock-ups overcame the bias inherent in the technology used for prototyping. The<br/>available prototyping tools were unable to accommodate the craft skills that were used to meet the aesthetic requirements of newpaper page layout."</p>
        <p>"The new design team shifted the focus of requirements analysis from the acquisition of an expert rule base to the support of the mechanics’ judgment in diagnosing maintenance needs... ...This design approach resulted in a system for experts rather than an expert system."</p>
        <p>"...the essence of the objectivist position “is to apply models and methods derived from the natural sciences to the study of human affairs. The objectivist treats the social world as if it were the natural world” [18, p. 71. In contrast, the subjectivist position denies the appropriateness of natural science methods for studying the social world and seeks to understand the basis of human life by delving into the depths of subjective experience of individuals."</p>
        <p>"The neohumanist paradigm seeks radical change, emancipation, and potentiality, and stresses the role that different so-<br/>cial and organizational forces play in understanding change. It focuses on all forms of barriers to emancipation-in particular, ideology (distorted communication), power, and psychological compulsions and social constraints-and seeks ways to overcome them."</p>
        <p>"The role of management is that of the leadership group in the organization that knows or develops the ends which are then translated and specified in terms of systems objectives. The usual assumption is that the specification is as objective as possible. The resolution of polemical issues associated with objectives is seen as the prerogative of management and not normally within the domain of the systems developer."</p>
        <p>"The [analyst as systems expert] story, therefore, has a number of potential dysfunctional consequences. For one, the primary emphasis is on investigating means rather than discussing ends. There is an implicit assumption that the ends are agreed. But in reality, ends are controversial and the subject of considerable disagreement and debate. By assuming the ends and thus sys,tem objectives are agreed, legitimation can become<br/>little more than a hollow force or thinly concealed use of power. The prespecified ends meet the needs of certain system stakeholders at the expense of others." [relates well to Cateye example - store owners perceived interests dominated users?]</p>
        <p>"[The analyst as faciltator] recognizes that knowledge about human means and ends is not easily obtained because reality is exceedingly complex and elusive. There is no single reality, only different perceptions about it. Business does not deal with an objective economic reality, but one that evolves through changing traditions... ...The developer should work from within the users’ perspective and help them to find their preferred views. He or she should ease the transition from one viewpoint to another, thereby alleviating possible resistance to change."</p>
        <p>"To achieve consensus or acceptance, continuous interaction among all parties is critical. Through interaction, objectives emerge and become legitimized through continuous modification. Systems cannot be designed in the usual sense, but emerge through social interaction. The mechanism of prototyping or evolutionary learning from interaction with partial implementations is the way technology becomes embedded into the social perception and sense-making process."</p>
        <p>"[In the analyst as labor partisan story s]ystems developers ... choose...to side with the workers, designing systems which help their<br/>interests. In this case, they should use technology to enhance labor’s traditional skills and craftmanship, attempting to make work both more rewarding-economically and psychologically - and deliver a better product"</p>
        <p>"In pursuing the knowledge interest in emancipation, the system developer elicits (through interaction) a shared understanding of the many obstacles to human communication. The developer needs to acquire an appreciation (insider knowledge) of the different viewpoints and existential situations of the different stake-holder groupings."</p>
        <p>"The developer needs to consider the following typical obstacles to human communication throughout systems development: 1) Authority and illegitimate power-they create anxieties and cause people to distort or withhold information in order to protect themselves.<br/>2) Peer opinion pressure (“group think”)-it creates tunnel vision for the sake of loyalty, reducing the validity of judgments by suppressing possible validity checks through criticism. 3) Time, space, and resource limitations they prevent universal access to knowledge even though in principle it is available. This includes the common situation that knowledgeable people remain silent due to lack of motivation to participate because of work overload or the socially created need to withhold important information unless it is to one’s advantage to engage in a debate. 4) Social differentiation-differences in the level of education, specialization and personal values and beliefs increase the risk of misunderstanding. 5) The bias and limitation of language use--distort perceptions and lead to narrow problem definitions through jargon and cognitive anchoring....Legitimate system objectives emerge from a free and open discussion that leads to a shared understanding and does not suffer from the harmful effects of these barriers."</p>
        <p>
            <em>[suggesting a radical development methodology based on technical function, mutual understanding and emancipation]</em>"All systems development would proceed with the three knowledge interests in mind. Systems would have features to support the technical knowl-<br/>edge interest and these would be similar to those developed under the functionalist influence. Other features would support the creation of shared meanings and reflect the knowledge interest in mutual understanding. This is similar to systems inspired by social relativism.<br/>Finally, there would be a comprehensive set of features to support emancipatory discourse."</p>
        <p>"The systems developer acts as a social therapist andemancipator in an attempt to draw together, in open discussion, the various stakeholders."</p>
        <p>"Prototyping is the practical way of handling the subjective and emerging nature of requirements (cf. [26]). Prototyping, though originally conceived as an approach in its own right [82], is incorporated within the requirements specification stage of the structured approaches to mitigate the rigidity of the functionalist assumption of modeling “true requirements.” In prototyping, users and analysts interact to construct a working model of the system which is then “refined and modified in a continuous process, until the fit between user and system is acceptable” [19, p. 1631.</p>
