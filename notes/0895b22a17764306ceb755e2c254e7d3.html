        <p>"This paper describes an investigation into the adoption and use of UML in the software development community. A web-based survey was conducted eliciting responses from users of UML worldwide. Results indicate a wide diversity of opinion regarding UML, reflecting the relative immaturity of the technology as well as the controversy over its effectiveness."</p>
        <p>"Promoted as a unified approach which incorporates the ‘best practices’ of previous notational methods, UML promises to relieve some of the problems associated with object-oriented software development. However, there is a severe lack of empirical evidence supporting the claim that UML leads to greater performance and a number of problems continue to be reported concerning its usage (e.g. complexity, inconsistency, difficulty to learn, incompleteness)."</p>
