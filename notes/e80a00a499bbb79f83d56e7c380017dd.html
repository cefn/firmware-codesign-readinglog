        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>Patrick uses the example of a case-study around a computer game design firm. Initially comments on the variety of established software development methodologies and their explicit or unspoken failings, around the centrality of planning. He goes on to examine the practice of software development as exercised by the case study firm in which improvisation could be said to be central, although this doesn't mean 'out of control' on Giddens definition (introduced page 17). He uses a theory of the human activity which separates aspects of Signification, Domination and Legitimation, in which Communication, Power and Sanction act through Interpretive Schemes, Resources and Rules respectively (three parallel aspects) - see diagram on Page 6. I really like the contrast between Flux and Sedimentation as it maps well to design theory, in which many alternatives are generated by some processes, and they are culled in others.</p>

        <p>"There are many formal approaches that have been proposed for controlling software projects...the Waterfall Model (Royce, 1970) ...breaks the IS development process down into discrete stages such as feasibility study, systems investigation, and implementation (Avison and Fitzgerald, 1995). There are a number of similar structured systems development methods such as Structured Systems Analysis and Design Methodology (SSADM) (Fitzgerald, 1996) and even some forms of agile development like XP (Beck, 1999). The typical stages in the<br/>development lifecycle occur in a linear sequential manner with a provision for feedback loops between the stages (Boehm, 1988)."</p>
        <p>"process models and other innovations such as high-level languages like object-oriented, have not improved the ability to control the software development process (Pressman, 1987); they were not ‘silver bullets’ (Brooks, 1995)."</p>
        <p>"Therefore, there is the suggestion of letting-go in order to control when developers are seen to be capable, that they can deal with the<br/>complexity of the situation as it emerges (Bach, 1995). This is consonant with the amethodical view of software development, which promotes embracing complexity and ambiguity. Unlike metric-driven process improvement, amethodical development emphasizes the different voices and interests of the developers, as well as negotiation that lead to compromise solutions (Truex et al, 2000:p.71)." [this is critical also to the dynamic of co-design and the general discourse around Boundary processes]</p>
        <p>"normative methodical software development approaches are employed as a social defense so as to “avoid the risks of real engagement with each other and with the task at hand. They turn away from the exigencies of work and take refuge in a surreal world.” [credited to Wastell]</p>
        <p>"Improvisation therefore carries the hallmarks of control in its potential to bring about order from chaos (e.g.Highsmith, 2002; Ciborra 1999).Yet it is largely regarded as something distinct from control and a concept that requires further research (Brown and Eisenhardt, 1995). This is not surprising as control usually infers planning, whereas improvisation does not usually involve this." [related to software requirements capture vs. co-design?]</p>
        <p>"I then used structuration theory (Giddens 1984) as a theoretical lens (Orlikowski, 2000) to guide the analysis and interpret the data."</p>
        <p>"if they did not need a feature then it was not put it in, unless there was time left over for such ‘bells and whistles’. Identifying what was a feature and what was a bell or a whistle was constantly being decided on-the-fly."</p>
        <p>"Despite the constant communication between client and QGS in the form of reports and art samples there was still a lack of shared understanding. They seemed to be talking past each other, not clarifying meanings but making assumptions. It was only when a playable prototype was presented to the client that an awareness of acommunication breakdown emerged."</p>
        <p>"I now draw on the three associated dimensions and related elements of Giddens’ Structuration theory as a lens by which to interpret the themes of communication, power, and legitimation. I relate to communication to efforts to understand project details such as requirements and design, power relates to improvisation, and legitimation relates to norms of software development."</p>
        <p>"Legitimation could therefore lead to non-routine actions. Given the designs were construed as being ambiguous for instance, this provoked a stream of non-routine improvised activities in order to fill the ‘interpretive holes’ in the design in-use. The communication process therefore had the potential to significantly flex the game development practices. Indeed, play-testing was a practice that enabled the clarification of the meanings of the design in-use. Therefore, while play-testing constituted a non-routine and improvised activity, its repetition simultaneously contributed to the sedimentation of the design in-use and thereby also the process as a whole"</p>
        <p>"The communication process involved intense and ingenious efforts to make sense of equivocal designs in-use. To exercise their power over or improvise around ambiguity, the actors engaged in an intense interplay between (re)interpretation and play-testing. Play-testing was the act by which the actors performed a game prototype, i.e. a manifestation or “build” of a design in-use. Sometimes this occurred as a distinct phase in the innovation process, or through the use of a design tool. The play-test performance contributed to efforts to make sense of designs in-use, stimulating interpretation and reflection"</p>
        <p>"Through ongoing design improvisation, so a collective sense of designs in-use emerged, which contributed to design sedimentation and control. It may be imagined then that design improvisation was like a vortex or spiral that inched ever closer towards sedimentation,"</p>
        <p>"The implication here is that where the requirements and design have a strong aesthetic component, improvisation may be a more salient process control strategy."</p>
