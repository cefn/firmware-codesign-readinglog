        <p>"Our findings show that the amount of effort invested has a direct effect (as a result of the extended period of time spent with the product) and an indirect effect (via the personalised product’s self-expressive value) on the strength of the emotional bond with the product. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of these findings for product designers."</p>
        <p>"In today’s markets, many consumer durables are comparable with respect to their features, quality, and user friendliness. This forces designers to find new ways to differentiate their products from competitors."</p>
