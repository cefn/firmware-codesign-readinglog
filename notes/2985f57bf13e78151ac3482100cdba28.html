      "A series of WOZ iterations has the potential to deliver a more or less
      complete specification of the system's input/output behaviour which&#160;
      can then be safely implemented."
    </p>
    <p>
      "WOZ is not equally suited to support all design processes. We propose to
      delimit the design process types for which WOZ should be considered, as
      follows. Firstly, the interactive system behaviour to be simulated should
      be behaviour which humans are good at performing. This class of behaviour
      includes cognitively demanding skills which humans learn to master from
      early on. However, there does not seem to be any reason in principle why
      later acquired expertise might not also be considered for WOZ simulation.
      Secondly, as systems with such interactive skills are still difficult to
      build, it is necessary to focus on the design of systems having
      relatively narrow and well-defined application domains as far as their
      cognitively demanding task aspects are concerned.""

      "This paper addresses the need for a systematic presentation,
      conceptualisation and discussion of the WOZ technique as a systems design
      method"
    </p>
    <p>
      "when should WOZ be preferred to other prototyping techniques which are
      probably less demanding in resources? What is needed to set up WOZ
      experiments? When should a series of WOZ iterations start and stop? And
      what are the main problems in designing with WOZ?"
