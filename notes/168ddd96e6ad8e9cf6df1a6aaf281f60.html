        <p>"Digital computers are an electronic manifestation of a far older cultural practice: the invocation. An invocation is an event that begins with a call, and ends with a becoming. An invocation is when some entity calls on another entity to execute a task. It is a point of decision that delegates a task to something outside the subject. It is characterised by a power relation and a language act. The digital computer is a media form characterised by its capacity to mediate invocations. "</p>
        <p>"Most genealogies of computers trace the computer’s genesis to traditions of symbolic abstraction: mathematics, physics and engineering (Randell 1982). I think it is equally productive to look to a wider range of cultural practices including techniques and technologies, language, and magic."</p>
        <p>"An invocatory device puts a part of the world at the user’s command. It reliably calls up a certain effect with a minimal effort. People make delegations to invocatory devices in the faith that they will be answered."</p>
        <p>"Invocational practices often recall speech in a more abstract way. Invocational media operate entirely through ‘calls’, even if they are not heard by human ears. Programmers invoke calls to subroutines, peripheral devices and remote services. Interfaces offer a silent call and response — a command entered on the keyboard is answered by an image on screen"</p>
        <p>"Invocational media develop as a kind of hyper-extended invocatory device. Where an invocatory device invokes a single, named effect (ringing a door bell, turning on a light, playing a note), invocational media insert an interval of indeterminacy between a user’s invocations and the invoked effects. The user’s command is delegated to a specialised component, the central processing unit, and is stored up in memory devices (see Chapter Four). The decision that invokes the output from that command is deferred, sometimes for milliseconds, and other times for an extended period. The CPU and memory separate input from output, opening up the invocational space for quasi-linguistic computer languages which articulate complex logical and arithmetical transformations and conditional effects. This move from single invocatory effects to invocational sequences fuses command, memory and decision to create the general purpose computer. Beyond this threshold these devices become invocational media."</p>
        <p>"there is a hidden dogmatism behind the imperative to have a particular kind of critical position...The modern university can be almost as rigid as the system that preceded it...Anyone writing a PhD in [Cultural Studies] needs to find a way to become a specialist in not being a specialist."<br/>
            <br/>"You can’t assume that the field exists prior to the work that constitutes that field."<br/>
