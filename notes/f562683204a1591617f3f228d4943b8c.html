      A guide for writing firmware, which like "The Firmware Handbook" seems to
      entirely overlook user experience design.

      Quotations

        <p>
      "All too often the customer-management, your boss. or the end
      user-doesn‘t really know what they want until they see a working system.
      It’s clearly a Catch-22<br/>
      situation."
    </p>
        <p>
      "The solution is a prototype of the system’s software. running a minimal
      subset of the application’s functionality. This is not a skeleton of the
      final code, waiting to be fleshed out after management puts in their two
      cents. I’m talking about truly disposable code."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Build just enough code to get the desired result. Real systems need a
      spec that defines what the product does; a rapid prototype needs a spec
      that spells out what won’t be in it."
    </p>
        <p>
      "you’ll need an understanding of what decisions will be made as a result
      of the prototype. If the user interface will be pretty much
      constant<br/>
      no matter what turns up in the modeling phase, hey-just jump into final
      product development. If you know the answer, don’t ask the question!"
    </p>
        <p>
      "The raison d’etre for the prototype is to identify problems and make
      changes. Get these decisions made early by producing something in days or
      weeks.<br/>
      Develop a schedule with many milestones where nondevelopers get a chance
      to look at the product and fiddle with it a bit."
    </p>
        <p>
      "All embedded people must understand that their creation does not exist
      in isolation; the code and the chips all function together, to form the
      seamless gestalt that (you hope) delights the user."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Too many of us view our profession parochially, somehow feeling that
      college is the only route to design. Part of this probably stems from the
      education itself, where instructors without doctorates cannot become full
      professors."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Doctors and lawyers plaster degrees and awards over the walls...have
      very effective professional associations that limit entry into the field
      to those people with a degree- from a school approved by the
      association...Electronics is very different. We’re in a much younger
      field, where a bit of the anarchy of the Wild West still reigns."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Few would deny that firmware is a disaster area, with poor-quality<br/>
      products getting to market late and over budget. Don’t become resigned
      to<br/>
      the status quo."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Yet integration shouldn’t even exist as a line item. Integration
      im-<br/>
      plies we’re only fiddling with bits and pieces of the application,
      ignoring<br/>
      the problem’s gestalt, until very late in the schedule when an
      unexpected<br/>
      problem (unexpected only by people who don’t realize that the reason
      for<br/>
      test is to unearth unexpected issues) will be a disaster.<br/>
      The only reasonable way to build an embedded system is to start in-<br/>
      tegrating today, now, on the day you first crank a line of code. The
      biggest<br/>
      schedule killers are unknowns; only testing and actually running code
      and<br/>
      hardware will reveal the existence of these unknowns."
