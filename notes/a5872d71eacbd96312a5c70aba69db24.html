        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>Describes the double diamond at a high level for decision makers in business as a justification for commissioning designers. Details a collection of tools, such as service blueprinting, service safaris etc. which are appropriate for each phase of a design process.</p>
        <p>In the terms of this whitepaper, the FCD technique could be seen as a hybrid between Service Blueprinting and Experience Prototyping, interactively tested through prompted scenarios.</p>
        <p>The Business Model Canvas offers an inspiring simplification for annotating the firmware design task, maintaining lists such as resources under contention, inputs, outputs, what have you.</p>
        <p>Notes for brainstorming include the following 'rules to remember'...<div>Defer judgement, Build on the ideas of others, Focus on the topic, One conversation at a time, Encourage wild ideas.</div>

        <h2>Relevance</h2>
        <p>The perspective clarified here will help position the FCD technique as a tool which fits at a particular location in this well-known model of design. The other tools indicated within the document are. User Journey Mapping, User Diaries, Service Safaris, User Shadowing, User Personas, Brainstorming, Design Brief, Service Blueprinting, Experience Prototyping, Business Model Canvas, Scenarios</p>
        <p>It can also offer a positioning finding parallels and contrasts with the field of firmware design versus that of service design.</p>
        <h2>Quotations</h2>
        <p>
            <div>This is a brief introduction to why design methods can be useful when developing services. If you’re new to service design: You can use it to familiarise yourself with a typical process that designers use when developing products and services. It will give you an idea of what to expect from working with a designer.</div>

            <div>Why work with a designer? ...User understanding...Prototyping...[pictures and models as]...A tool for collaboration</div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <div>A service happens over time and is made up of touchpoints – the people, information, products and spaces that we encounter...Service design is the process of creating these touchpoints and defining how they interact with each other and with the user.</div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <div>The start of a project is a period of discovery, gathering inspiration and insights, identifying user needs and developing initial ideas...The second quarter represents the definition phase, in which designers try to make sense of all the possibilities identified in the Discover phase....The third quarter marks a period of development where solutions are created, prototyped, tested and iterated. This process of trial and error helps designers to improve and refine their ideas....The final quarter of the</div>
            <div>double diamond model is the Deliver phase, where the resulting product or service is finalised and launched.</div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <div>A Service Blueprint is a detailed visual representation of the total service over time - showing the user’s journey, all the different touchpoints and channels, as well as the behind the scenes parts of a service that make it work...The customer oriented elements of a service are known as the ‘front stage’. Identify and map touchpoints and processes that need to happen behind the scenes for the ‘front stage’ part to work. These might include back office staff, logistics systems, or IT infrastructure. This is known as the ‘back stage’ part of the service. A Service Blueprint allows you to see the interaction between the front and back stages, ensuring links and dependencies between different service elements are coherent.</div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <div>Experience Prototypes are about communicating what the experience will be like and allow the</div>
            <div>design team to test and refine their solutions with potential users. They also help build buy-in from partners and other stakeholders....There are lots of different methods for Experience Prototyping – some such as bodystorming and role play emphasise acting out a service experience. Others focus on creating mock-ups of products or environments. Generally, most Experience Prototypes combine physical mock-ups and some elements of role-play to recreate the service experience.</div>
