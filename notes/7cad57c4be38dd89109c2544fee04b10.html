        <p>"In this paper, we review the Wizard of Oz method and highlight its usefulness throughout the evolution of a user interface or system."</p>
        <p>"The WOz method helps designers avoid getting locked into a particular design or from working under an incorrect set of assumptions about the usersâ€™ preferred mode of interaction, because it enables design exploration and evaluation before investing the considerable development time needed to build a complete prototype."</p>
        <p>"WOz studies are auseful tool for evaluating partially complete systems and to advance the design of the underlying technology. We believe that one reason for the limited use of the WOz method is the effort required to engineer a successful WOz interface and integrate it with a partially complete system."</p>
        <p>"By reducing the barriers to creating and reusing WOz interfaces throughout the design cycle, designers are more likely to utilize this evaluation method"</p>
        <p>"We explain the event-based model and networking infrastructure used in DART to support WOz. We then provide technical details about the high-level tools integrated into the prototyping environment to support rapid development of wizard interfaces and visualization of wizard study results."</p>
