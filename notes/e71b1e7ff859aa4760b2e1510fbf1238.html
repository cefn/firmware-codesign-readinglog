        <p>This is the summary of analysis of many Participatory Ergonomics activities over many years<em>
                <strong>[wikipedia:The participatory approach to ergonomics relies on actively involving workers in implementing ergonomic knowledge, procedures and changes with the intention of improving working conditions, safety, productivity, quality, morale and/or comfort]</strong>
            </em>.</p>
        <p>They group boundary objects encountered in actual PE activities into 5 categories, then go on to identify 8 qualities which boundary objects may have. Many are listed under each category, based on Carlile and Wenger's work (except repositories). I have pulled out examples which may need special note within Firmware Co-Design (standard examples such as diagrams, lists etc have been omitted)</p>

            <li>
                <em>Build-in-affordances</em>to make a design develop or articulate its quality, e.g. placing bricks in the layout game, socially forces you to explain why it's good.</li>
            <li>
                <em>Rules and instructions for use</em>e.g. which color pen to use for marking up.</li>
            <li>Facilitator-selected - the fact the experience is crafted by a facilitator was noted.</li>
            <li>
                <em>Temporary learning space</em>the objects and context they create distance participants from daily routine and approaches.</li>
            <li>
                <em>Location</em>where objects are used is significant to the way people engage with them</li>
            <li>
                <em>Represent workshop outputs</em>the objects are a productive result of the effort and intent of the workshop, supporting incorporation into an ongoing design process, including a political character such as 'frozen boundary objects' presented to other actors.</li>

        <h2>Quotations</h2>
        <p>"Based on two case studies, we identify eight characteristics of boundary objects and their use, which make them particularly useful in PE design processes...The framework developed may serve to provide criteria to guide practitioners and intervention researchers in the selection of objects to facilitate a PE process."</p>
        <p>"Prototypes are physical or digital representations of a future artifact. Prototyping refers to the mutual learning process that takes place in a collaborative design setting."</p>
        <p>"Inspired by Horgen et al. (1999), we used workbooks with a selection of pictures from the current workplace, which workers could comment on, using colored pens (Fig.1). A three-color code was used to indicate, for example, good solution, problematic solution, and problem to be solved."</p>
        <p>"Boundary objects are needed that can create a common language, which allows all participants’’ knowledge and ideas to be represented. Focusing on PE design, it is also important to identify boundary objects that have the ability to act as design objects. They must be objects-in-the-making."</p>
