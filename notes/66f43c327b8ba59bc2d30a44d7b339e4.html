    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Related to the ADM reverse-engineering practice recommended by the OMG,
      related to figuring out the ontology? of a real world system and modelling
      it.</p>
    <h2>Field of Study</h2>

    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>software modernization [suggests a mapping to firmware modernization]</p>

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"The Knowledge Discovery Meta-model plays the fundamental role in this
      set of representations as it defines common concepts of software assets
      and their operational environments."</p>
    <p>"although this meta-model minimizes the effort required to obtain
      representation, it has several drawbacks that limits its capability to
      express domain specific knowledge"</p>
    <p>"numerous issues arise during project execution: which views of
      modernizing systems to create; how to represent these views in order to
      comprehend the business logic implemented in the system; what knowledge
      extraction methods and techniques to employ; and finally, how to properly
      evaluate and validate resulting assets"</p>
    <p>"software modernization [is] the process of understanding and evolving
      existing software assets in order to: maintain, integrate, refactor,
      reuse, migrate, or replace"</p>
    <p>"the multi-tier software architecture..." [Tiers: <em>Data, Data Access,
        Processing Logic, Presentation Logic, Presentation</em>]</p>
    <p>"layers" Infrastructure, Program Elements, Runtime Resources,
      Abstractions</p>
    <p>"The KDM representation of the software system starts by the Inventory
      model that represents software artefacts and keeps traceability to the
      original source. A set of Code models represents the structure
      (association, composition, aggregation, and inheritance relationships) and
      behaviour (data and control flow) of the source code. The Data, Platform,
      Event, and UI models represent the structure and behaviour of the run-time
      resources of the system. The Conceptual, Structure, and Build models
      represent highest level abstractions obtained from the models of lower
      level of abstractions, the data processed by the system, and different
      kinds of software’s documentation." [See Table1 layout within paper - very
      informative]</p>
    <p>"Numerous techniques exist for the extraction and comprehension of
      knowledge about software architecture in the field of reverse engineering.
      Apart from the straightforward techniques that incorporate parsing the
      content of software artefacts and direct transformation to elements of KDM
      in order to produce “as-is” representation of the software, the
      clustering-based, patterns-based, and model slicing-based techniques may
      be employed to derive higher level abstractions in automatic or
      semiautomatic way."</p>
    <p>"The light-weight extension mechanism provides capability to: define of
      stereotypes that may extend either concrete or abstract meta-model
      elements; define tags associated with stereotypes and add values (in a
      form of string or reference to some modelling element) to them; group
      stereotypes into stereotype families; use one or more stereotypes within
      extended meta-model element." [offers a semi-formal extensible dimension
      to KDM, possibly could support workshops, though the authors criticise how
      relationships between these extensions cannot be constrained enough to be
      meaningful for domain modelling themselves]</p>
