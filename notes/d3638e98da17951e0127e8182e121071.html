        Project</a></h1>
    <h2>Authors</h2>
    <p>Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>They designed (non-functional) objects for use in people's homes with a
      suggestion they would mediate electronic waves or something. They
      documented the reactions people had, how they used the objects.</p>
    <h2>Field of Study</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"In short, we are collectively asking what it means to live in this
      electronic world we are creating, whether this world reflects our values,
      who is entering into this world that we are designing and whom we are
      leaving behind. These questions are at least as philosophical as they are
      technological, and there is more than one way to approach them: science
      and technology studies, philosophy of technology, and similar fields offer
      one strategy. Another is the emerging area of research through design or
      constructive design"</p>
