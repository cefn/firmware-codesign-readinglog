        Assemblages in Design: An Ethnographic Study</a></h1>
    <h2>Authors</h2>
    <p>Alex Wilkie</p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;Studied a large microprocessor firm as they transformed themselves
      to be more 'user-centred' where those users were downstream adopters of
      microprocessors. Consequently some of the case studies they take on are
      actual deployments of devices using those micros.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Consequently the industrial setting is very close to that of Firmware
      engineers. They are studying the upstream teams (making processors), but
      the specific team is also involved in the study of the downstream teams
      (complicated).</p>
    <p>The examples of user engagement act as a counterexample to my hypothesis
      about firmware engineers, perhaps (e.g. in-home interviews to design
      diabetes devices) - though doesn't go as far as co-design. Of course, a
      big deal depends on how this material was consumed in downstream
      development if at all.</p>
    <p>This is a really valuable and detailed record of working practices which
      deserves in-depth analysis, even though most of the examples drift into OS
      and GUI-based design.</p>

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"This thesis: (1) reviews how the user is variously applied as a
      practico-theoretical concern within human-computer interaction (HCI) and
      as an object of analysis within the sociology and history of technology;
      (2) outlines a methodology for studying users variously enacted within
      design practice; (3) examines how a non-user is constructed and
      re-constructed during the development of a diabetes related technology;
      (4) examines how designers accomplish user-involvement by way of a
      gendered persona; (5) examines how the making of a technology for people
      suffering from obesity included multiple users that served to format the
      designers’ immediate practical concerns, as well as the management of
      future expectations; (6) examines how users serve as a means for
      conducting ethnography-in-design."</p>
    <p>"The corporation in which I conducted my fieldwork is a leading
      multinational microprocessor manufacturer in the computing industry. As
      such, it is a commercial organization that pursues the research,
      development, production, marketing and standardisation of microprocessors,
      as well as various ICT technologies associated with semiconductors and
      microprocessors."</p>
    <p>"The group was internally structured into different areas of expertise,
      including: human factors, engineering and usage requirements, design
      research, software and hardware development and engineering, user
      interaction design and industrial design, user experience evaluation,
      mechanical engineering, administration and operations"</p>
    <p>"The [User-Centred Design Group] acted as a resource for the application
      of user-centered design principles and practices to innovation activities
      across the corporation"</p>
    <p>"collaborations necessarily involved the application of UCD principles in
      the development of computing technologies. Such systems included an
      interactive device to support the early detection and onset of Alzheimer’s
      disease and a fully functional computer system targeted at Chinese
      families. In both cases UCDG collaborated with different divisions within
      the corporation, and partnered with outside<br>
      organizations, such as a leading voluntary health organization in
      Alzheimer care, support and research. The group also had an ongoing
      relationship with a small team of anthropologists and ethnographers also
      working for the corporation who were engaged in the strategic<br>
      exploration of emerging microprocessor markets and usages. As a
      consequence, technologies and their associated user models and
      representations circulated amongst a variety of stakeholders and audiences
      within both the corporation and external organizations."</p>
    <p>"As a substantive starting point to this thesis, I examine the role of a
      non-user in mediating the expectations of a design team tasked with
      inventing and designing a system to enhance the management of diabetes...
      ...I examine the in-home interview and the innovation meeting in relation
      to the production, encoding and visual ordering of sociotechnical data
      that mediated the involvement of a user in the design process. I describe
      how the interview rendered an<br>
      existing patient-user in ‘thick’ ethnographic detail."</p>
    <p>"I explore how designers achieved an example of user involvement by way
      of a fictional representation of a housewife. I describe how a design
      team, again drawn from the UCDG, put together and employed a persona to
      resource the design and development of a household media management system
      intended to be used in the kitchen"</p>
    <p>"In this chapter I examine how a diverse cast of users resourced the
      construction of a prototype health and fitness technology, and how, in
      turn, the prototype served in the configuration of multiple users. The
      daily exercise prototype (DEP) – a combination of mobile phone software
      and wearable sensors – was formulated as a ubiquitous computing (ubicomp)
      technology to address the causes of obesity, as well as to allow patients
      suffering from the disease to self-manage treatment"</p>
