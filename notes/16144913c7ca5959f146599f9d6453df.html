    <p>
      Highly relevant as it connects interaction design and pattern language as
      a mechanism for referencing and considering alternative design choices
      appropriate for the early, divergent, design phase, using techniques
      intended for collaborative design. Reports on a worked example of a
      pattern language for websites as a domain of interaction design.

      Quotations
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Patterns, he said, can empower people by providing a<br />
      living and shared language...Alexander intended for patterns to be used
      by everyday people to guide the process<br />
      of creation, whether designing a house for themselves or working with
      others designing offices<br />
      and public spaces. By creating a common language, would-be designers
      could discuss and take<br />
      part in the design of the spaces in which they worked, lived, and played.
      Alexander’s patterns<br />
      were also a reaction against contemporary architectural design, which he
      felt did not take enough<br />
      of human needs, nature, growth, spirituality, and community into
      consideration." £ strong resonance with our ambitions for firmware
      co-design
    </p>
    <p>
      "As in Alexander’s pattern language, each pattern is connected to certain
      higher-level<br />
      patterns and to certain lower-level patterns. The pattern helps complete
      the higher-level patterns<br />
      that are “above” it, and it is completed itself by the lower-level
      patterns that are “below” it."
