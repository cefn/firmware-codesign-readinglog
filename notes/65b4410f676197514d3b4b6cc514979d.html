      "important to every well  educated designer in our own field to
      reflect upon the re­ lation between design methodology for computer
      artifacts <br/>
      and the experiences with different generations of design 
      methodologies in other fields." 
    </p>
        <p>
      "human practice and understanding in everyday life should be taken as the
      ontological and epistemological point of departure in inquiries into
      design and use of com­puter artifacts."
    </p>
        <p>
      "I first look for 'internal alternatives', internal in the sense that
      they either emanate from within computer science, or are more concerned
      with the development of systems thinking than with taking a non-system
      view. And there are alternatives. What I find is social system design
      methods that we can use right away. I also find a new foundation for
      design, and a new potential for design in the use prototyping software
      and hardware."
    </p>
        <p>
      "any discipline which deals with the subject matter of design of computer
      artifacts should be able to theoretically and<br/>
      methodologically treat design as including aspects like interventions
      into practice, as communication between users and professional designers,
      as a creative process, and as a concerned human activity."
    </p>
        <p>
      "tool per­spective - the ideal of skilled workers and designers in
      cooperation designing computer artifacts as 'craft' tools for skilled
      work"
    </p>
        <p>
      "the prevailing situation in industry today, where computer artifacts
      more often are designed as machines, in the sense that they take control
      away from the user and automate skill"
