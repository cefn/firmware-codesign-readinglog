      “Most modern modeling languages and methods - UML and the unified process
      most definitely among them - have been devised with a highly focused
      concern for representing procedures, information, and software
      structures. The needs of interaction design and designers have been
      addressed, if at all, in afterthought. Instead of well-conceived
      notations and techniques, interaction designers have been given awkward
      adaptations of models conceived for completely different and largely
      incompatible purposes.”</span>
