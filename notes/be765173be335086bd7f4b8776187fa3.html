        <p>"component frameworks...provide a means of enforcing desired architectural properties and invariants by constraining the interactions"</p>
        <p>"A type management system offers one level of constraints, i.e. a new component must be a valid substitution of the old component (cf. subtyping of the respective interfaces). This is however not enough; it is also important to take a more global view of the architecture in determining the validity of adaptations. For example, changing a compression component may require a similar change to the peer decompression component. Similarly, it may be necessary to preserve a given architectural style over time such as pipes-and-filters. Our approach is to record such constraints explicitly in the architecture and to ensure that adaptations preserve the architectural rules before committing the changes (cf. atomic transactions)."</p>
        <p>"the approach described above is applied recursively in that a component within a component graph may itself have architecture...This recursion terminates with primitive components, which have no visible underlying structure, and whose internal implementation details are inaccessible to the programmer."</p>
