        <p>"We present some results of a survey of 113 software practitioners conducted between April and December 2007. The aim of the survey was to uncover their attitudes and experiences regarding software modeling, and development approaches that avoid modeling"</p>
        <p>"In a model-centric approach, the developers look to the model to see the design, and change the model as the first step in performing any design change. Extensive modeling is performed, and the coding is either automated, or at least straightforwardly determined from the model. In a code-centric approach, the code is seen as the main artifact; developers understand the design by understanding the code, and the process of design change is equated with changing the code."</p>
