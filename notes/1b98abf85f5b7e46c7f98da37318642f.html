    <p>"We present some results of a survey of 113 software practitioners
      conducted between April and December 2007. The aim of the&nbsp; survey was
      to uncover their attitudes and experiences regarding&nbsp; software
      modeling, and development approaches that avoid&nbsp; modeling"</p>
    <p>"In a model-centric approach, the developers look to the model to see the
      design, and change the model as the first step in performing any design
      change. Extensive modeling is performed, and the coding is either
      automated, or at least straightforwardly determined from the model. In a
      code-centric approach, the code is seen as the main artifact; developers
      understand the design by understanding the code, and the process of design
      change is equated with changing the code."</p>
