        <p>Although this covers the general concept of bricolage as introduced by Levi-Strauss and developed by many others, it also highlights the approach of bricolage adopted by researchers, who employ trans-disciplinary techniques, rather than being restricted by the 'engineering' tools of a single discipline. There is the potential for my work to mirror the intended structure of user tasks, by itself being a bricolage of research themes. If so, I am which type of Bricoleur (according to Denzin's and Lincoln's 'five types'?</p>
        <p>It's interesting to consider how the work in Firmware co-design might link to Foucault's political perspective of 'subjugated knowledge' - in other words are users' voices silenced by the power-dynamics of the industry which creates firmware-driven products.</p>
        <p>However, the perspective outlined in this paper is logically independent from the notion of bricolage which is central to Firmware Co-Design work, which is about putting users in the position of Bricoleur, by delivering the right materials and task context for them to express their creativity and desires.</p>

        <p>"This article means to address [the complexity of the bricolage approach] by providing a thick, yet accessible, introduction to bricolage as an approach to qualitative inquiry."</p>
        <p>"while [the] greatest attention in this article is devoted to contextualizing bricolage and introducing influential theorists, it also provides key examples of research that adopts the bricolage approach"</p>
        <p>"The etymological foundation of bricolage comes from a traditional French expression which denotes crafts-people who creatively use materials left over from other projects to construct new artifacts. To fashion their bricolage projects, bricoleurs use only the tools and materials “at-hand”"</p>
        <p>"[Denzin and Lincoln] use the bricolage metaphor to articulate how researchers embraced flexibility and plurality by amalgamating multiple disciplines (e.g., humanities, social sciences), multiple methodologies (e.g., ethnography, discourse analysis, deconstruction, Foucauldian geneaology), and varying theoretical perspectives (e.g., feminism, Marxism, and post-colonialism) in their inquiry."</p>
        <p>"For Denzin and Lincoln there are five types of bricoleurs who embrace this rigor and complexity: the interpretive bricoleur, the methodological bricoleur, the theoretical bricoleur, the political bricoleur, and the narrative bricoleur."</p>
        <p>"interpretive bricoleurs are tasked to reflexively piece together their research (i.e., they not only examine an object of inquiry, but also scrutinize how their positioning affects their research processes)"</p>
        <p>"[A] methodological bricoleur is a researcher who combines multiple research tools to accomplish a meaning-making task...engages in fluid, eclectic, and creative approaches to inquiry....respects the complexity of the meaning-making process by allowing contextual contingencies to dictate which data-gathering and analytical methods to use"</p>
        <p>"Theoretical bricoleurs, for Denzin and Lincoln, work through, and between, multiple theoretical paradigms: “the theoretical bricoleur reads widely and is knowledgeable about the many interpretive paradigms...that can be brought to any particular problem"</p>
        <p>"...political bricoleurs are researchers who are aware of how knowledge and power are connected. [Denzin and Lincoln] explain: “The political bricoleur is aware that science is power, for all research findings have political implications. There is no value free science"</p>
        <p>"...narrative bricoleurs appreciate that inquiry is a representation (i.e., a narrative). Because objective reality can never be “captured” (p. 5), research texts can only represent specific interpretations of a phenomenon... ...Narrative bricoleurs appreciate how ideologies and discourses shape how knowledge is produced. Instead of taking these ideologies and discourses for granted, they seek to understand their influence on research processes and texts."</p>
        <p>"Denzin and Lincoln consider bricolage to be more than multi-methods research. They see it as an approach that enables researchers to respect the complexity of the meaning-making and inquiry process. In this way, it challenges the basis of traditional multi-methods research. For example, a bricoleur challenges the traditional principle that researchers should remain neutral observants in a research<br/>context"</p>
        <p>"[Kincheloe's] bricoleurs not only seek to develop complex understandings of a phenomenon (e.g., an understanding of the multiplicity of ways phenomena can be interpreted), they aim to disrupt imbalances of power, social injustice, marginalization, and oppression perpetrated through traditional meaning-making practices."</p>
        <p>"Kincheloe’s bricolage exists as a critical response to positivist research...[the] assumption that scientific research will lead to the development of an understanding of world, and human interaction, in “concrete and universal terms”...for Kincheloe, human<br/>knowledge construction does not lead to universal “truths” nor can it be considered a linear or tidy process"</p>
        <p>"Kincheloe sees monological research as problematic for two reasons: first, it puts constraints around knowledge production; and second, it overlooks dynamics of power."</p>
        <p>"For Kincheloe (2008), monological research problematically examines objects as things-in-themselves, detached from the socio-historical contexts of which they are constituted. This means, for him, that monological methods are<em>
                <strong>inadequate for studying educational phenomena</strong>
            </em>. In education, he explains, contexts, relationships, and politics all play complex mediating roles." [my italics]</p>
        <p>[Via Kincheloe and Foucault &amp; Gordon] "Truth is a thing of this world . . . And it induces regular effects of power. Each society has its regime of truth, its general politics of truth: that is, the types of discourses which it accepts and makes function as true; the mechanisms and instances which enable one to distinguish true and false statements, the means by which each is sanctioned; the techniques and procedures accorded value in the acquisition of truth; the status of those who are charged with saying what counts as true. (Foucault &amp; Gordon, 1980, p. 133)"</p>
        <p>"Subjugated knowledges, for Foucault, are the “series of knowledges that have been disqualified as nonconceptual knowledges, as insufficiently elaborated knowledges: naive knowledges, hierarchically inferior knowledges, knowledges that are below the required level of erudation or scientificity” (p. 7). For example, the knowledges constructed by institutions like asylums, hospitals, and schools shape dominant knowledges, while the knowledges constructed by groups like the “psychiatrized, the patient . . . the delinquent” (Foucault et al., 2003, p. 7), and the student, constitute subjugated knowledges."</p>
