        <p>"An assumption behind this paper is that research aimed at improving design practice in general and more specifically interaction design practice is not as successful as it could be. We will argue that one reason for this is that the understanding of what constitutes designerly tools is not enough developed among those who propose new tools for interaction design. We define designerly tools as methods, tools, techniques, and approaches that supports design activity in way that is appreciated by practicing designers."</p>
