        <p>"Want an example of an unnecessarily complicated, frustrating device? Take my piano. The conrols of the Roland piano shown in figure 1.3 are perplexing beyond belief...saving the settings for a device...is a frequent operation for any device that has numerous adjustments and settings. How are the users of this piano expected to save their settings?</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Hold down the [Split] button, and press the [Chorus] button.</li>
            <li>Press the [Metronom/Count In] button (buP should appear in the display)</li>
            <li>Press the [Rec] button</li>
        </ol>
        <p>...The steps are so arbitrary and unnatural that each time I have to do this, the first attempt always fails, even with the manual open in front of me. This is an expensive piano, with a great mechanical feel to the keys and excellent acoustics mirroring the rich subtleties of the best acoustic pianos. But the company completely neglected the controls for the piano....In other words, the piano controles were an afterthought, with no attention paid to the needs of the customer - a violent contradiction to the care and concern that wen't into designing the musical quality of the piano.</p>
        <p>Usually when I see bad design, I try to imagine what forces were involved to cause such a poor result. In this particular case, I fail. The reasons are unfathomable. Even the Owner's Manual is unintelligible....The major cause of complicated, confusing, frustrating systems is not complexity: It is poor design"</p>
