        <p>
      "Sketches are produced in many domains to communicate<br/>
      with self or others. They are a kind of external<br/>
      representation serving as a cognitive tool to augment<br/>
      memory and information processing by relieving the mind<br/>
      of some of those burdens. Sketches schematize."
    </p>
        <p>
      "[sketches]...reveal people’s conceptions of domains....novices
      extract<br/>
      structural information...Experts are also able to extract
      functional<br/>
      information...that must be inferred"
    </p>
        <p>
      "One role of a sketch is to check<br/>
      the completeness and internal consistency of an idea,<br/>
      especially a spatial idea."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Another role of sketches for self  is to see new relations and
      figures [which]...can promote new ideas"
    </p>
        <p>
      "map sketches simplify, even distort, the<br/>
      information included to conform to the structure to be<br/>
      conveyed. The structure captured by sketches is not the<br/>
      structure of the environment, but rather, the conceptual<br/>
      structure of the information."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Sketches from other domains have the same character; that<br/>
      is, they consist of a small set of stylized elements that are<br/>
      combinatoric."
    </p>
        <p>
      "It is not trivial to say that people can extract from sketches<br/>
      what sketchers intended. How often have we returned to<br/>
      our own sketches, and writings, only to be bewildered by<br/>
      what was meant to be conveyed."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Across a number of  domains, including maps and diagrams of
      devices, what is<br/>
      meant to be conveyed is structure."
    </p>
        <p>
      "The arrows  convey temporal order, allowing viewers to
      mentally<br/>
      animate (Hegarty, 1992) the device."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Practicing architects made more functional<br/>
      inferences from their own sketches than students of<br/>
      architecture. For example, practictioners were more likely<br/>
      to “see” patterns of movement and patterns of light in their<br/>
      sketches than students. "
