    <h2>Relevance</h2>
    <p>Proposes a pattern language for embedded systems. Acts as a demonstration
      how within computer science pattern languages are intended for the
      consumption of programmers, rather than as Alexander intended - a means of
      engagement with a collaborative group. Embedded systems, for DeLano does
      not mean a system which interacts with a user, which is a shame as I'm
      sure many of them do. </p>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"I would like to see a Pattern Language developed that covers the essence
      of building embedded systems.<br>
      This Pattern Language should take into account existing literature, as
      many of the Patterns already written<br>
      should find homes within the Pattern Language. I am especially interested
      in work on the part of the<br>
      Pattern Language that would flesh out OS Abstraction Layer."</p>
