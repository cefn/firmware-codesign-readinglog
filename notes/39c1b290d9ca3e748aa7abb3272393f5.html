        <h2>Relevance</h2>
        <p>Explicitly links design methodology and software development, suggesting that engineering design and critical design perspectives are in conflict and not enough is brought in from the creative dimension.</p>
        <h2>Quotations</h2>
        <p>"Many times, I have reflected on the remarkably bad fit between how the process is described in normative process models and methodologies,<br/>and how it is performed in practice. As this paper tries to show, I attribute the misfit to different views of the external design work, i.e., design of the behavior<br/>and appearance of the system, the services it offers its users and its place in the organization."</p>
        <p>"I will argue that the normative models are typically based on an engineering<br/>design perspective whereas external design in many respects<br/>is better described from a creative design perspective.</p>
