      "We find very little research that looks at how other fields of design
      may help us do better<br/>
      software design, or that discusses whether software design is so
      different that it cannot<br/>
      draw from other fields of design. Thus, our exploration of the question
      posed in the title of<br/>
      this paper “Is designing software different from designing other things?”
      "
    </p>
        <p>
      "We believe that software design is different. In this paper we identify
      major differences<br/>
      between software design and other forms of design,"
    </p>
        <p>
      "software design is different because:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>the activities that make up the software design field...span more
      expertise and domain boundaries
      </li>
            <li>the optimum software design process is the reverse of the process for
      hard object or product design
      </li>
            <li>the design specification is the software source code ...which is
      complete enough to generate automatically an end product ...without
      translation into human understood forms
      </li>
            <li>the finished outcome of software design is both a complex adaptive
      system (CAS) and a component of other complex adaptive systems at the
      same time (Noun 3)."
      </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
      "Software is often used for computer aided design or simulation, as
      well<br/>
      as embedded into the product to make it more interactive."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Given our examples, and that software is a material without substance,
      we claim that it is likely that there are no<br/>
      first principles of software design to find."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Simon [2] states “Everyone<br/>
      designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing
      situations into preferred<br/>
      ones.” "
    </p>
        <p>
      "Dym<br/>
      and Little [5] describe the scope and detail of the hard design process
      in steps that are<br/>
      recognizable for most design disciplines:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Client Statement and Need
      </li>
            <li>Problem Definition
      </li>
            <li>Conceptual Design
      </li>
            <li>Preliminary Design
      </li>
            <li>Detailed Design
      </li>
            <li>Design Communication
      </li>
            <li>Final Design (Fabrication specifications and documentation)
      </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
      Within the domain of software design, following the above steps in order
      is known as the<br/>
      waterfall method."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Schon provides insights on how to improve design thinking through the
      process of reflection and double loop learning."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Dym and Little [5] point out that an important aspect of industrial
      design is that it is<br/>
      typically done with teams of individuals who not only include the product
      designers but<br/>
      also manufacturing and distribution engineers. Such teams design in
      parallel to optimize<br/>
      the product through its entire life cycle of design, building,
      distributing and operating. This<br/>
      process of concurrent engineering increases the complexity of the design
      process."
    </p>
        <p>
      "we assert that the source code is the software design specification
      (Noun 2), since<br/>
      the manufacturing step has been essentially eliminated by widespread and
      powerful build<br/>
      tools that rapidly create the end product from the source code"
    </p>
        <p>
      "Chris Langton [12] at the Santa Fe Institute ... discovered that
      flocking behavior in birds could be simulated with three rules"
    </p>
        <p>
      "Both the Boids and Koan programs are the results of a few rules
      interacting. Most programs<br/>
      used in business, games and consumer software products have tens of
      thousands of<br/>
      interacting rules. Further, these CAS software designs are embedded in
      and surrounded by<br/>
      thousands of other software designs like operating systems, database
      systems, middleware<br/>
      and the World Wide Web infrastructure. The result is a living mixture of
      emergent<br/>
      behavior that seemingly mimics living systems."
    </p>
        <p>
      "New<br/>
      behaviors emerge as the software is being developed, as it is put into
      operation, and as its<br/>
      environment (its ecosystem) changes. These quickly change both the user’s
      and the<br/>
      developer’s views of what is needed and what could be. Thus, software
      projects almost<br/>
      never deliver what they initially expected to deliver. Their plans are
      fluid in the extreme –<br/>
      not because people don’t put in sufficient effort to plan, but because
      they cannot accurately<br/>
      predict the results of the CAS they are building."
    </p>
        <p>
      "the software developer tends to jump in and start producing something
      without incorporating<br/>
      any explicit design methodology...the value of an up-front design is
      less<br/>
      compelling if CAS theory implies that we cannot understand what the
      design will produce<br/>
      until we execute the design"
