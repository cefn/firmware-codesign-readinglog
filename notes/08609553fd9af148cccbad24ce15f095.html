        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>They start with a design critique of a VHS and progress to the design of a test harness which explores experimenting with co-design of interfaces in real time. They claim..."By building on H y p e r C a r d we can use external c o m m a n d s and functions to extend possible user interaction modes beyond button p u s h i n g - - allowing developers to create fully functional interfaces such as the one we created for the PC-VCR."...but was it really fully-functional? Is this an example of people thinking that UI design is the same as software design. Did it actually record video!? If not, there may be many hidden aspects which weren't featured. How much does this matter? How can this be mitigated?</p>
        <p>They use a 'grey shade' for hiding complexity, later thought of as 'greyed out' - possible link to flight instrument where various things can be disclosed and offered in different circumstances, and more information is not necessarily good (also mentioned by John Cross related to his Medical instruments - face to face at Manteigas event).</p>
        <p>They explicitly discuss the link to 'Scandinavian' workplace democracy - the precursor of Participatory Design.</p>

        <p>"Both theoretical arguments and empirical evidence indicate a strong cause-and-effect relationship between development approaches permitting realistic conditions for prototype evaluation and successful interface development efforts."</p>
        <p>"Storyboard prototyping can be defined as<br/>' . . . a technique designed to generate consensus and closure via a tangible, interactive systems concept. It permits users to participate in the requirements validation process, and it provides an audit trail of the requirements analysis process . . . . The presentation of the interactive storyboard to users and managers is intended to evoke comments and criticisms' [13, p. 39]"</p>
        <p>"Delay associated with production of the next version of the storyboard is a source of frustration for storyboard developers. Too much time between user review sessions leads to loss of cognitive momentum and can introduce errors to and perpetuate omissions in the development process."</p>
        <p>"[Cooperative Interactive Storyboard Prototyping] empowers users with tools and techniques encouraging them to interactively contribute to real-time, storyboard use, evalua-<br/>tion and modification. Crucial here is the concept of the role of the user changing from reviewer to codeveloper."</p>
        <p>"CISP also provides situations in which users can evaluate the storyboard prototypes under realistic circumstances and modify them in real time."</p>
        <p>"According to Bodker and Gronbaek, a major obstacle is the developer's limited ability to respond smoothly to user ideas or requests for prototype changes during design sessions [6]."</p>
