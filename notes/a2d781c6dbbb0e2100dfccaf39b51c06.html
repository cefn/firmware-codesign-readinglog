        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>Recommended by Andy Darby regarding our discussion around 'real co-design' where participants make design decisions as opposed to merely in the ideas generation phase.</p>
        <p>Contains a plot with orthogonal axes indicating how much the user is a subject of study or a partner, and which contrasts design-led projects with research-led projects. For example, cultural and design probes are positioned as being at the 'user as subject' end, where it's intended to feed a designer's insights, not engage users as partners in design.</p>
        <p>It also contains an excellent table comparing probes, toolkits and prototypes, relating these concepts to the dimensions described above.</p>
        <p>Sanders and Stappers establish 'toolkits' as a central concept.</p>

        <p>"In the traditional design process, designers usually engage in making after the design opportunity has already been identified."</p>
        <p>"In research through design, prototypes can play a number of roles (Stappers 2010).<br/>. Prototypes evoke a focused discussion in a team, because the phenomenon is ‘on the<br/>table’.<br/>. Prototypes allow testing of a hypothesis.<br/>. Prototypes confront theories, because instantiating one typically forces those<br/>involved to consider several overlapping perspectives/theories/frames.<br/>. Prototypes confront the world, because the theory is not hidden in abstraction.<br/>. A prototype can change the world, because in interventions it allows people to<br/>experience a situation that did not exist before."</p>
        <p>"[I]n the very earliest phase of the design process,...making activities are used as vehicles for collectively (e.g. designers and codesigners together) exploring, expressing and testing hypotheses about future ways of living"</p>
        <p>"Brandt, Binder, and Sanders (2012) describe how practices of participation take place in iterative cycles of making, telling and enacting"</p>
        <p>"People use ...toolkit components to make artefacts about or for the future...[they] give non-designers a means with which to participate as codesigners in the design process." [in table comparing Probes, Toolkits, Prototypes]</p>
        <p>"This process is iterative, with the tail end of the post-design phase leading to the front end of another design process... [In] Participatory Action Research...iterations are fundamental to the unit of analysis."</p>
        <p>"probes, emanating from an expert-driven mindset, exemplify a designing for approach and cover both pre-design and generative components. Generative toolkits come from a participatory mindset and use the designing with approach primarily in the generative phase. Prototyping, on the other hand, can be conducted from either a designing for or a designing with mindset"</p>
        <p>"Service design tends to advocate intensive user participation or sometimes codesigning."</p>
        <p>"Sterling (2013) provides a formal definition; ‘Design fiction is the deliberate use of diegetic prototypes to suspend disbelief about change’. Thus, design fiction serves to enlarge, enrich and activate our capacity for making sense of future ways of living before we actually get there."</p>
