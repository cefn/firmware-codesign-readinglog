        <p>""Structure" is one of the most important and most elusive terms in the<br/>vocabulary of current social science. The concept is central not only in<br/>such eponymous schools as structural functionalism, structuralism, and<br/>poststructuralism, but in virtually all tendencies of social scientific<br/>thought. But if social scientists find it impossible to do without the term<br/>"structure," we also find it nearly impossible to define it adequately."</p>
        <p>"The term structure empowers what it designates. Structure, in its nom-<br/>inative sense, always implies structure in its transitive verbal sense."</p>
        <p>"A social science trapped in an unexamined metaphor<br/>of structure tends to reduce actors to cleverly programmed automatons."</p>
        <p>"structural language lends itself readily to explanations of how social life is shaped into consistent patterns, but not to explanations of how these patterns change over time. In structural dis-<br/>course, change is commonly located outside of structures, either in a telos<br/>of history, in notions of breakdown, or in influences exogenous to the<br/>system in question. Consequently, moving from questions of stability to<br/>questions of change tends to involve awkward epistemological shifts"</p>
        <p>"Sociologists typi-<br/>cally contrast "structure" to "culture." Structure, in normal sociological<br/>usage, is thought of as "hard" or "material" and therefore as primary<br/>and determining, whereas culture is regarded as "soft" or "mental" and<br/>therefore as secondary or derived"</p>
        <p>"This article will attempt to develop a theory of structure that overcomes<br/>the three cardinal weaknesses of the concept as it is normally employed<br/>in social science. The theory will attempt (1) to recognize the agency of<br/>social actors, (2) to build the possibility of change into the concept of<br/>structure, and (3) to overcome the divide between semiotic and materialist visions of structure"</p>
        <p>"Structures shape people's practices, but it is also people's<br/>practices that constitute (and reproduce) structures." [credited to Giddens]</p>
