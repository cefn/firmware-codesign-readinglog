    <p>&nbsp;Introduces the notion of placing the user at the centre of computer

    <p>"[Boehm's] proposal, a "spiral model" of software development,
      incorporates user involvement, prototyping and iterative design."</p>
    <p>"the multiplicity of computer industries...share a need to examine current
      practices and search for new ones to meet hte challenge of developing
      usable, useful interactive software..[to] adapt the hard-earned lessons of
      one development context and apply them in others. The potential benefits
      are new techniques, processes and organizational structures for
      development".</p>
