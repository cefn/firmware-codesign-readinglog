    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Reports on the history of visual tools used in mining engineering, with a
      very strong representation of the actual emergence and adoption of
      blueprint technology.</p>
    <h2>Field of Study</h2>

    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"The term “blueprint” became a synonym for “plan” at least as early as
      1926, according to the Oxford English Dictionary."</p>
    <p>"Since the message – the drawing – was duplicated perfectly by the
      blueprint process, the medium itself was overlooked. However, the
      introduction of the blueprint process spurred dramatic changes in how
      businesses, including mining companies, were organized both spatially and
      conceptually. Blueprints helped consolidate authority in the space of the
      engineering office and in the hands of upper management."</p>
    <p>"With blueprints, it became significantly easier for documents to make
      the transition from the safe confines of the office into the hazardous
      spaces of the production plant, above and below ground. This in turn made
      it far easier to precisely convey the engineers’ vision of work to be
      performed to those who would do the actual labor, and it allowed the
      engineers themselves to bring their visual representations with them to
      help them with decisionmaking while on-site."</p>
    <p>"If information was inscribed on a blueprint, the data did not become
      part of the information flow of the operation until it was inscribed on
      the original non-blueprint master tracing."</p>
    <p>"Compare this centralized, pyramidal structure of knowledge authority
      with the pre-blueprint situation. Each tracing of a map, if intended to be
      complete, was essentially indistinguishable from the original, leading to
      the possibility of parallel, competing visual representations, each with
      the possibility of being inscribed with new information and thus “forking”
      the flow of data. The Quincy Mine employed one potential solution to this
      problem - the primary map was inscribed on heavy stock, backed with
      canvas. Any map on tracing linen, therefore, was easily noticeable as a
      copy. This posed a problem later, however, with the introduction of
      blueprinting to the firm, since blueprints could not be made from the
      opaque master-map, and had to be made from a master-copy instead."</p>
    <p>"Fundamentally, the maps, models, photographs, blueprints, and museum
      exhibits I describe in earlier chapters were means of rendering visible
      places that could otherwise not be seen. For mining engineers, many visual
      tools could be used directly in the day-to-day business of mining, or to
      help them gain the upper hand in legal struggles or in the realm of safety
      and the work habits of miners. At the same time, the ability to create and
      use maps, models, photographs, blueprints, and exhibits depicting
      underground spaces was almost always the prerogative of mining engineers,
      mine owners, and other elites such as corporate-minded museum curators.
      Accordingly, everyday miners have appeared in my account only rarely,
      mostly as those whose habits and labor engineers wished to control.<br>
      Nonetheless, miners themselves had myriad ways to depict and understand
      the underground spaces in which they worked. A rich repertoire of mining
      folklore included supernatural beings, both malevolent and those, such as
      the famous Cornish “tommyknockers,” that helped the miner by warning him
      of impending danger. Miners used candle flames or chalk to create
      underground graffiti, such as that captured in a Lewis Hine photograph of
      a trapper and a heavy door in a West Virginia bituminous coal mine (shown
      in the Photographs chapter). Miners also created songs about their work.
      Folklore, graffiti, and music were all ways that miners sought to give
      meaning to their work and their workplace, and to communicate that meaning
      to other miners and to outside audiences.</p>
    <p>"[William Keating's] was a universal story about mine work that was
      embedded in the dirty patched blue jeans, in the grimy cap and rusty lunch
      pail. Anyone, I believed, could see these pants and understand their
      resonance. 5 These artifacts brought the story of working in a coal mine
      to life more vividly and authentically than anything else could.</p>
