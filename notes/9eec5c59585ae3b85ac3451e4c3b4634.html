    <p>"New domains such as domestic and<br>
      public environments, new influences from the arts and<br>
      humanities, and new techniques in HCI itself are converging<br>
      to suggest that multiple, potentially competing interpretations<br>
      can fruitfully co-exist. In this paper, we lay out the contours<br>
      of the new space opened by a focus on multiple<br>
      interpretations, which may more fully address the<br>
      complexity, dynamics and interplay of user, system, and<br>
      designer interpretation."</p>
