        <p>"XP is an agile method that develops object-oriented software in very short iterations with little upfront design. Although not originally given this name, TDD was described as an integral XP practice necessary for analysis, design, and testing that also enables design through refactoring, collective ownership, continuous integration, and programmer courage."</p>
        <p>"With TDD, the programmer writes the unit tests prior to the code under test. As a result, the programmer can immediately execute the tests after they are written."</p>
        <p>"The driven in test-driven development focuses on how TDD leads analysis, design, and programming decisions. TDD assumes that the software design is either incomplete or pliable and open to changes."</p>
        <p>"A software development process or methodology defines the order, control, and evaluation of the basic tasks involved in creating software. Software process methodologies range in complexity and control from largely informal to highly structured."</p>
        <p>"Developers classify these methodologies as prescriptive or agile and label the specific types as waterfall, spiral, incremental, or evolutionary."</p>
        <p>"Iterative development involves repeating a set of development tasks, generally on an expanding set of requirements. Evolutionary approaches involve adaptive and lightweight iterative development. Being adaptive refers to using feedback from previous iterations to improve the software. Being lightweight refers to the lack of complete specifications at the beginning of development, thus allowing feedback from previous iterations and from customers to guide future iterations. Lightweight can also refer to other aspects such as a process’s level of formality and degree of documentation."</p>
        <p>“For every tiny bit of functionality in the production code, you ﬁrst develop a test that speciﬁes and validates what the code will do. You then produce exactly as much code as will enable that test to pass”</p>
