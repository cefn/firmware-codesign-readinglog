        <p>"The field of interaction design deals with the development and use of interactive products, systems and services. It is an interventionist discipline in that it aims at transforming the current state of events through the introduction of something novel. Some interaction design projects radically rethink and transform the situation, whereas others incrementally develop existing systems and practices; however, innovation and creativity play a crucial role in most interaction design projects due to this transformative agenda."</p>
