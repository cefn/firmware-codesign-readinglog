    <p>"Unfortunately, due to ridiculous historical circumstances, computers
      have been made a mystery to most of the world. And this situation does not
      seem to be improving. You hear more and more about computers, but to most
      people it’s just one big blur. The people who know about computers often
      seem unwilling to explain things or answer your questions. Stereotyped
      notions develop about computers operating in fixed ways—and so confusion
      increases. The chasm between laymen and computer people widens fast and
      dangerously. This book is a measure of desperation, so serious and abysmal
      is the public sense of confusion and ignorance. Anything with buttons or
      lights can be palmed off on the laymen as a computer. There are so many
      different things, and their differences are so important; yet to the lay
      public they are lumped together as “computer stuff,” indistinct and beyond
      understanding or criticism. It’s as if people couldn’t tell apart camera
      from exposure meter or tripod, or car from truck or tollbooth."</p>
    <p>"the use of computers is dominated by a priesthood, people who spatter
      you with unintelligible answers and seem unwilling to give you straight
      ones"</p>
    <p>"great concern and consideration has always gone into calculating the
      “correct” teaching sequence for each “subject.” In recent years radical
      new teaching sequences have been introduced for teaching various subjects,
      including mathematics and physics. But such efforts appear to have been
      misinformed by the idea of supplanting the “wrong” teaching sequence with
      the “right” teaching sequence, one which is “validated.”...this all
      ignores a simple fact: all are arbitrary. Instructional sequences aren’t
      needed at all if the people are motivated and the materials are clear and
      available... Prearranged sequences become unnecessary if the student can
      see what he has yet to learn, then pursue it."</p>
    <p>"Until now, the mechanical properties of external objects determined what
      they were to us and how we used them. But henceforth this is arbitrary. <br>
      The recognition of that arbitrariness, and reconsideration among broader
      and more general alternatives, awaits us."</p>
    <p>"The human mind being as supple as it is, anything whatever can be used
      to control systems. The problem is having it be a comprehensible whole. As
      already remarked, our ability mentally to unify things is extraordinary.
      That we somehow tie together clutch, gear, accelerator and brake into a
      comprehensible control structure to make cars go and stop should amaze and
      instruct. Engineers and “human factors” people speak as though there were
      some kind of scientific or determinate way to design control systems.
      Piffle. We choose a set of controls, much like an artist’s Palette, on the
      basis of general appropriateness; and <em><strong>then try best and most
          artistically to fit them to what needs doing</strong></em> [my
      italics]. The result must be conceptually clear and retroactively
      “obvious”—simply because clarity is the simplest way to keep the user from
      making mistakes. Clear and simple systems are easier to learn, harder to
      forget, less likely to be screwed up by the user, and thus are more
      economical—getting more done for the resources put in."</p>
    <p>"Careless and horrible designs are not all fictitious. One egregious
      example also indicates the low level of design currently going into some
      responding systems: computer people have designed CRT writing systems for
      newspapers which actually have a “kill” button on the console, by which
      authors would accidentally kill their stories. In a recent magazine
      article it was explained that the eventual solution was to change the
      program so that to kill the story you had to hit the “kill” button twice.
      To me this seems like a beautiful example of what happens when you let
      insulated technical people design the system for you: a “kill” button on
      the keyboard is about as intelligent as installing knives on the dashboard
      of a car, pointing at the passenger."</p>
    <p>"When computer programmers or other technical people design particular
      systems without thinking more generally, things are not<br>
      likely to be either simple or combinable. What may result are intricate
      user-level controls for one particular function, controls that are
      differently used for another particular function, making the two functions
      not combinable."</p>
    <p>"any system of controls can gradually come through use to have a
      psychological organization, even spuriously. The trap is that we so easily<br>
      lose sight of arbitrariness and even stupidity of design, and live with it
      when it could be so much better, because of this psychological melding."</p>
    <p>"The fantic structure of anything, then, consists of its noticeable
      parts, interconnections, contents and effects. I claim that it is the
      fantic unity—the conceptual and presentational clarity of these
      things—that makes fantic systems—presentational systems and material—clear
      and helpful, or not."</p>
    <p>"The branching computer screen, together with the selfsame computer’s
      ability to turn anything else on and off as selected by the user, and to
      fetch up information, yields a realm of option in the design of media and
      environment that has never existed before."</p>
    <p>"interior computer technicalities have to be SUBSERVIENT, and the
      programmers cannot be allowed to dictate how it is to behave on the basis
      of the under level structures that are convenient to them. Quite the
      contrary: from the fullest consideration of the richest upper-level
      structures we want, we the users-to-be must dictate what lower-level
      structures are to be prepared within"</p>
