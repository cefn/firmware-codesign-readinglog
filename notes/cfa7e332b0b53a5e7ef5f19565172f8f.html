        pictures mean? Guidelines for experimental evaluation of representation
        fidelity in diagrammatical conceptual modeling techniques</a></h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Lit review, covering experimental materials supporting 'conceptual
      modeling' in systems analysis and design, substantiated by 'meaningful
      tests of domain semantics' - "research aimed at empirically evaluating ...
      diagrammatic notations... to convey semantics of a real world domain".
      They contrast 'read' tasks and 'write' tasks in experiments, and focus on
      'read' tasks. They proceed to analyse prior experiments within a model of
      evidential quality and procedural legitimacy which they outline at the
      beginning of the paper. </p>
    <p>They focus on formal validity questions, e.g. controlled variables in
      subject selection, choice of lab versus ex-lab. Four contrasting
      experimental design aspects are highlighted, independent variables, <strong><em>dependent
          measures, participants and procedures</em></strong>.</p>
    <p>Recommend 'informational equivalence' so that the semantic delivery of
      different representations. They see dependent measures, such as a test of
      competence which combines knowledge represented with prior knowledge, to
      be problematic. They point out that Subject Matter Experts must not be
      used! (though they accept this undermines external validity) [a
      methodological challenge for CDPF? Does it need a modelling formalism for
      firmware?]. They feel that 'scripts' or representations should not be
      removed during assessment, as this focuses more on learning than on
      content transmitted, and is more externally valid. They propose an
      approach to obfuscate details from information, making them 'semantically
      void' such that prior knowledge cannot be used.</p>

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"Researchers involved in experiments to evaluate conceptual modeling
      techniques need to design<br>
      materials, develop dependent measures, select subjects, and design
      procedures that enable the<br>
      objectives of the experiment to be met. We believe there is a pressing
      need for more controlled<br>
      experimental studies that will improve our theoretical understanding of
      how the modeling con-<br>
      structs used in diagramming techniques facilitate comprehension of domain
      semantics for the pur-<br>
      poses of communication and validation"</p>
