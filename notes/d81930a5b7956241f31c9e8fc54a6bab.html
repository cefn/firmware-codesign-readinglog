      Notes
    </h2>
    <p>
      All the usual suspects in Boundary Objects terms are referenced,
      including that Henderson paper again, which I can't lay my hands on. He
      looks into the way boundary objects relate to each other and have
      intertwined meanings, by treating them in the same way as texts might be
      treated, through discourse analysis. Definitely worth a read.

      "intertextual analysis represents a potentially valuable means of
      developing Bowker and<br />
      Star’s (1999) work on how multiple boundary objects coalesce to form
      ‘boundary<br />
      infrastructures’ (i.e. interwoven networks of boundary objects)."
