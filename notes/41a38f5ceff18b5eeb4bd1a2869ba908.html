        <p>Interesting that they consider this boundary object could be used by both users and engineers, but also ethnographers reporting on how devices<em>actually were</em>used. Suggests to me that the right sort of representative material might be used in multiple different roles. How many such roles are there? This suggests at least three. (e.g. Engineers communicating to users the<em>constraints</em>or<em>behaviour</em>of the existing design; Users communicating what they think it<em>should</em>do; Usability experts reporting on what<em>actually</em>happens in use.</p>

        <p>"Scenarios are descriptions of concrete system behaviours. They may summarise the behaviour traces of an existing system. More typically, however, they are useful during planning and design to describe systems that do not yet exist in a tangible, usable form."</p>
        <p>"We suspect that comics-style narrative scenarios can be effective boundary objects. One example of how this might work would be the ways in which requirement engineers might use scenarios to talk about what they think will happen, while ethnographers might construct narratives with similar structure, but that describe or composite what does (or at least did) actually happen. In a well-designed system, the first sort of narrative might be heavily based on the second sort."</p>
