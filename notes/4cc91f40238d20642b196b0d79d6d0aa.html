        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>This clearly positions the authors within an 'order of worth' which promotes mathematical modelling and 'real science' above softer design aspects as an educational foundation for embedded programmers.</p>

        <h2>Quotations</h2>
        <p>"The wall between computer science and electrical engineering has kept the potential of embedded systems at bay. It is time to build a new scientific foundation with embedded systems design as the cornerstone, which will ensure a systematic and even-handed integration of the two fields."</p>
        <p>"the shortcomings of current design, validation, and maintenance processes make software the most costly and least reliable part of embedded applications. As a result, industries cannot capitalize on the huge potential that emerging hardware and communication technologies offer."</p>
        <p>"When#embedded computing is taught at all, it is often as a course that emphasizes tinkering with sensors and actuators, not as an engineering discipline with a scientific foundation."</p>
