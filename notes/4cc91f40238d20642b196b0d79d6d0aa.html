    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>This clearly positions the authors within an 'order of worth' which
      promotes mathematical modelling and 'real science' above softer design
      aspects as an educational foundation for embedded programmers.</p>

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"The wall between computer science and electrical engineering has kept
      the potential of embedded systems at bay. It is time to build a new
      scientific foundation with embedded systems design as the cornerstone,
      which will ensure a systematic and even-handed integration of the two
      fields."</p>
    <p>"the shortcomings of current design, validation, and maintenance
      processes make software the most costly and least reliable part of
      embedded applications. As a result, industries cannot capitalize on the
      huge potential that emerging hardware and communication technologies
      offer."</p>
    <p>"When#embedded computing is taught at all, it is often as a course that
      emphasizes tinkering with sensors and actuators, not as an engineering
      discipline with a scientific foundation."</p>
