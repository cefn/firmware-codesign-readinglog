        <h2>Quotations</h2>
        <p>"devices everywhere are getting "smarter." My camera has a multi-modal hierarchical menu and form interface. Even my toaster<br/>has a microprocessor. Computing is not just for computers anymore"</p>
        <p>"A user-centered focus requires close work with users (not just customer-buy-<br/>ers), from analysis through design, evaluation, and maintenance. A lack of user-<br/>centered focus results in products and services that often do not meet the needs of<br/>their intended users."</p>
        <p>"Think for a minute<br/>about what you use in a typical day: cell phone, computer, personal organizer, re-<br/>mote control, soft drink machine, coffee machine, ATM, ticket machine, library in-<br/>formation system, the web, photocopier, watch, printer, stereo, calculator, video<br/>game.. . the list is endless. Now think for a minute about how usable they are.<br/>How many are actually easy, effortless, and enjoyable to use? This list is probably considerably shorter. Why is this so?" Â£</p>
        <p>"Many products that require users to interact with them...have been engineered as systems to perform set functions. While they may work effec-<br/>tively from an engineering perspective, it is often at the expense of how the system will be used by real people."</p>
        <p>"we begin with an example of a poorly designed system-voice mail-<br/>that is used in many organizations (businesses, hotels, and universities). We then<br/>compare this with an answering machine that exemplifies good design"</p>
        <p>"A key question for interaction design is: how do you optimize the users' inter-<br/>actions with a system, environment or product, so that they match the users' activi-<br/>ties that are being supported and extended? One could use intuition and hope for<br/>the best. Alternatively, one can be more principled in deciding which choices to<br/>make by basing them on an understanding of the users. This involves:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>taking into account what people are good and bad at</li>
            <li>considering what might help people with the way they currently do things</li>
            <li>thinking through what might provide quality user experiences</li>
            <li>listening to what people want and getting them involved in the design</li>
            <li>using "tried and tested" user-based techniques during the design process"</li>
        </ul>
