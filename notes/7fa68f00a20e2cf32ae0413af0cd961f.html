        <p>"The effects of computer animations and mental animation on people’s mental mod-<br/>els of a mechanical system are examined. In 3 experiments, students learned how a<br/>mechanical system works from various instructional treatments including viewing<br/>a static diagram of the machine, predicting motion from static diagrams, viewing<br/>computer animations, and viewing static and animated diagrams accompanied by<br/>verbal commentaries. Although students’ understanding of the system was im-<br/>proved by viewing both static and animated diagrams, there was no evidence that<br/>animated diagrams led to superior understanding of dynamic processes compared<br/>to static diagrams."</p>
        <p>"static diagrams accompanied by verbal descriptions of the<br/>dynamic processes, static diagrams with arrows indicating the movement of the<br/>machine parts, and multiple static diagrams or “small multiples” (Tufte, 1997)<br/>showing different phases in the movement of parts of the device."</p>
        <p>"Because these displays are static, but the processes to be understood are kinematic or dynamic,<br/>their comprehension often depends on the ability to mentally animate the pro-<br/>cesses (Hegarty, 1992), that is, infer motion from static displays"</p>
        <p>"...we examine how well people can understand a machine by viewing static diagrams alone, when induced to mentally animate static diagrams, by<br/>viewing computer animations, and by viewing static or animated diagrams accompanied by verbal instruction. We provide an account of the mental models that people construct from these different media and how people reason from these mental models to diagnose faults in the mechanical systems."</p>
        <p>"Understanding a dynamic system such as a machine or a biological system involves several types of knowledge...the<em>
                <strong>configuration</strong>
            </em>of the machine...the<em>
                <strong>behavior</strong>
            </em>of the machine...the<em>
                <strong>function</strong>
            </em>of the machine."</p>
        <p>"Central to this is knowledge of the causal chain or chains of events in the machine’s behavior. It includes both kinematic understanding of<br/>how the different machine components move in space and affect each other’s movements and dynamic understanding of the forces that bring about these move-<br/>ments. This knowledge corresponds to a dynamic mental model of the machine."</p>
        <p>"Several recent studies have addressed how people learn about machines and other causal systems from text, diagrams, animations, and other related media (e.g., Faraday &amp; Sutcliffe, 1997a, 1997b; Hegarty &amp; Just, 1993; Mayer, 1997; Mayer &amp; Moreno, 1998; Mousavi, Low, &amp; Sweller, 1995; Tversky, Morrison, &amp; Betrancourt, 2002). Many of these studies are concerned with the conditions under which these media are most effective."</p>
        <p>"Animations portray the temporal changes in the operation of a machine explicitly so that they merely rely on ability to perceive these changes. In contrast, static diagrams rely on the student’s ability to infer these changes, which is generally assumed to be a more effortful and difficult process."</p>
        <p>"the literature to date has failed to show any advantage of animations over static media for explaining how machines work"</p>
        <p>"we examine the effects of computer animations and mental animation on people’s comprehension of a relatively complex mechanical system, the flushing cistern"</p>
        <p>"Rozenblit and Keil (2002) found that people have false confidence with respect to understanding of causal systems. Asking them questions about how a device works might shatter this false confidence and induce them to be more active in learning from the animation (e.g., pay more attention to parts of the process that they do not understand)."</p>
        <p>"One group just viewed a static diagram and were given no information about how the device moved (control condition); a second group viewed<br/>the static diagram and were then shown diagrams of three phases in a cycle of the<br/>flushing cistern and asked questions that induced them to predict how the system<br/>works (prediction condition). A third group first viewed the static diagram and<br/>then viewed an animation of the flushing cistern (animation condition). Finally,<br/>the fourth group viewed the static diagram, then viewed the three phase diagrams<br/>and answered questions about how the system works, and finally learned from an<br/>animation of the toilet tank (prediction and animation condition)."</p>
        <p>"We measured the ef-<br/>fects of the media on three comprehension measures: ability to describe the behav-<br/>ior of the system, ability to apply knowledge of how the system works to trouble-<br/>shoot possible breakdowns in the system’s functioning, and ability to state the<br/>function of different machine components." £ could provide measures of effectiveness for the boundary object?</p>
        <p>"Research on mental representations of continuous processes suggests that people tend to represent processes as a sequence of key events rather than as analog simulation of continuous motion (Zacks &amp; Tversky, 2001). Therefore, the three phases might be more similar to<br/>people’s mental representations of events than a continuous animation. " £ possibly important result for boundary objects</p>
        <p>"The first question is whether people can learn about how a mechanical system<br/>works from a diagram accompanied by a verbal description. The answer to this<br/>question is clearly yes, which is not surprising as it is consistent with the results of<br/>several previous studies (e.g., Hegarty &amp; Just, 1993; Mayer, 1997). A somewhat<br/>more surprising result of our experiments is that it does not matter whether the dia-<br/>gram is static or animated." £ this suggests some lo-fi representations of firmware sequences unfolding may be adequate</p>
        <p>"Consistent with this view, Table 2 in-<br/>dicates that the text was most effective in enhancing understanding of the flushing<br/>mechanism, which depends on an appreciation of the forces underlying the opera-<br/>tion of a siphon. Force is not a visible property; therefore, it cannot be easily con-<br/>veyed in a static or animated diagram." £ an intangible property needing to be represented or communicated here, but in a mechanistic system!</p>
        <p>"Miyake<br/>(1986) studied how pairs of people worked together to understand how a sewing<br/>machine works. She found that they went through cycles of understanding and not<br/>understanding as they gained deeper and deeper understanding of the device."</p>
        <p>"Rozenblit and Keil (2002) found that people overestimated their understanding of how everyday mechanical devices worked....functional knowledge did not typically include an understanding of the mechanisms by which the functions are achieved, information that is central to a complete understanding of a machine."</p>
        <p>"reading of static diagrams and text is self-paced and interactive in the sense that one can slow down or reread when one encounters a difficult passage. Therefore, it is possible that interactive animations, which allow the viewer to control the pace of the animation, might be more effective than animations that play at a constant rate."</p>
        <p>"Phenomena such as the self-generation effect (Slamecka &amp; Graf, 1978) and the self-explanation effect (Chi et al., 1994) suggest that people learn more effectively (and generate ideas or explanations) if they are more active in the learning process."</p>
        <p>"Similarly, people learn more from information presentations if they first participate in activities that activate their knowledge relevant to the topic of the presentation (Britton &amp; Graesser, 1996; Kintsch et al., 1993; McNamara et al., 1996) or generate the important distinctions relevant to understanding the topic (Schwartz &amp; Bransford, 1998)."</p>
        <p>"The research presented in this article indicates that such “external animations” are not always superior to our internal mental animation processes."</p>
