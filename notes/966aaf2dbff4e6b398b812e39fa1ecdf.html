      This is a review of a book which I now have on order. Quotations suggest
      why it would be so important, as well as being referenced by Susan Gasson
      when discussing boundary spanning of information systems design.

      "The authors’ central premise, and the one that motivates the cultivation
      of interaction designers within software development organizations, is
      that programmers do not make good interaction designers. The skill-set
      required to become a successful programmer is orthogonal to the skill-set
      of a successful interaction designer; this is not to say that programmers
      cannot be good interaction designers and vice versa, but some degree of
      re-tooling is required for a person to move successfully between the two
      functions."

      "A good design, Cooper and Reimann insist, must fit into the context of
      the goals of a user community. They introduce the construct of a persona,
      which models a goal-driven user for the purposes of software scenario
      design."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The authors state that all software can be categorized into four
      software postures, which are described in detail: sovereign, transient,
      auxiliary and daemonic. The sovereign posture is most frequently adopted
      by stand-alone applications that can assume they will be occupying the
      user’s full attention and screen real estate for the duration of the
      usage period. The transient posture is adopted by applications that are
      on the screen for short periods of time, and serve a narrow function,
      typically complementary to a sovereign application. A print utility is a
      good example of a transient posture. Programs that adopt the daemonic
      posture typically have no interaction with users, except for some type of
      configuration screen. And the auxiliary posture is a cross-breed between
      the sovereign posture and the transient, adopted in certain special
      cases."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The goal-directed design process was introduced in the first section of
      the book and breaks down into five phases: researching the users and the
      domain, modeling users and their contexts, requirements definition,
      framework definition and design of flow, and refinement of system
      behavior. The argument for pursuing a goal-directed design process would
      have been made much stronger if references to it were made throughout the
      book, to tie the elements of the process into the concrete elements of
      interface design"
