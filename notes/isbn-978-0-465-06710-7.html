    <p>"The development of a technology tends to follow a U-shaped curve of
      complexity: starting high; dropping to a low, comfortable level; then
      climbing again. New kinds of devices are complex and difficult to use. As
      technicians become more competent and an industry matures, devices become
      simpler, more reliable and more powerful. But ten, after the industry has
      stabilized, newcomers figure out how to add increased power and
      capability, but always at the expense of added complexity and sometimes
      decreased reliability. We can see the curve of complexity in the history
      of the watch, radio, telephone, and television set. Take the radio. In the
      early days, radios were quite complex. To tune in a station required
      several adjustments, including one for the antenna, one for the radio
      frequency, one for intermediate frequencies, and controls for both
      sensitivity and loudness. Later radios were simplere and had controls only
      to turn it on, tune the station and adjust the loudness. But the latest
      radios are again very complex, perhaps even more so than early ones. Now
      the radio is called a tuner, and it is littered with numerous controls,
      switches, slide boards, lights, displays and meters."</p>
    <p>"Whenever the number of functions and required operations exceeds the
      number of controls, the design becomes arbitrary, unnatural and
      complicated. The same tecnology that simplifies life by providing more
      functions in each device also complicates life by making the device harder
      to learn, harder to use. This is the paradox of technology."</p>
    <p>"...consider the digital watch, one with two-to four push buttons on the
      front or side. What are those push buttons for? How would you set the
      time? There is no way to tell - no evident relationship between the
      operating controls and the functions, no constraints, no apparent
      mappings."</p>
    <p>"...designers of computer systems seem particularly oblivious to the
      needs of users, particularly susceptible to all the pitfalls of design.
      The professional design community is seldom called in to help with
      computer products. Instead, design is left in the hands of engineers and
      programmers, people who usually have no experience, and no expertise in
      designing for people"</p>
    <p>"The abstract nature of the computer poses a particular challenge for the
      designer. The computer works electronically, invisibly, with no sign of
      the actions it's performing. And it is instructed through an abstract
      language, one that specifies the internal flow of control and movement of
      information, but one that is not particularly suited for the needs of the
      user."</p>
    <p>"Programmers should not be responsible for the computer's interaction
      with the user; that is not their expertise, nor should it be."</p>
    <p>"Computer scientists have so far worked on developing powerful
      programming languages that make it possible to solve the technical
      problems of computation. Little effort has gone toward devising the
      languages of interaction...As a resultmost programmers fluently write
      computer programs that do wonderful things but that are unusable by the
      non-professional. Most programmers have never though of the problems faced
      by the users. They are surprised to discover that their creations
      tyrannize the user."</p>
