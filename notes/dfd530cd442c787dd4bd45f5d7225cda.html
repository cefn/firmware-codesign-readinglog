      "One of our tools of analysis is the distinction between structural and
      intentional descriptions of artefacts. In designing typically a
      transition occurs between these two types of description: functions or
      purposes, which may be seen as intentional descriptions of the artefact
      to be designed, are transformed in structural or physical descriptions of
      this artefacts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Designing starts— also by Gero’s description, as we will see—with a
      purpose (an intentional concept) and ends with a structural description
      of an artefact (Kroes and Meijers 2002)."
