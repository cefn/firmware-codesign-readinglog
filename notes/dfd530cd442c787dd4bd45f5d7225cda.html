        <p>"One of our tools of analysis is the distinction between structural and intentional descriptions of artefacts. In designing typically a transition occurs between these two types of description: functions or purposes, which may be seen as intentional descriptions of the artefact to be designed, are transformed in structural or physical descriptions of this artefacts."</p>
        <p>"Designing starts— also by Gero’s description, as we will see—with a purpose (an intentional concept) and ends with a structural description of an artefact (Kroes and Meijers 2002)."</p>
