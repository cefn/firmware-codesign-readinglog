    <p>"As general-purpose programming languages, they are capable of
      representing any problem that computers can be used to solve, and as open
      systems<br>
      they let users change any aspect of the system if necessary. Although
      these systems are useful as computational substrates, they by themselves
      are insufficient for meta-design. The essential problem with these systems
      is that they provide the incorrect level of representation for most
      problems [Shaw, 1989]. Expressing a problem and designing a solution in
      these systems requires creating a mapping from the context of the problem
      to the core constructs provided by the programming language and its
      supporting library. On the other side of the spectrum, domain-specific but
      closed systems (e.g., SimCity 4 [Electronic-Arts, 2004]) provide extensive
      support for certain problem contexts, but the ability to extend these
      environments is fundamentally limited."</p>
    <p>"we will first provide some arguments for the desirability and need of
      meta-design. We will then develop a conceptual framework for meta-design
      and illustrate the approach with prototype developments mostly drawn from
      our own work. The description of meta-design approaches in several
      application areas (with a focus on interactive art) shows the potential
      and applicability of the concept."</p>
    <p>"Extending the traditional notion of system design beyond the original
      development of a system, meta-design [Fischer &amp; Scharff, 2000;
      Giaccardi, 2003] includes a process in which users become co-designers not
      only at design time, but throughout the whole existence of the system."</p>
