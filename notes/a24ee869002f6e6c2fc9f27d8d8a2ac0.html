        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>Dominated by the notion of the embodied 'desktop' or general computing interface as it escapes the confines of the WIMP metaphor, illustrated by a history of the WIMP metaphor. Introduces and reminds us of a whole host of relevant perspectives as it has commonalities with firmware design questions. A critical theory sort of paper too. This has been scanned, but triggered so many related explorations (e.g. Nelson, Norman) that it hasn't been fully assessed.</p>

        <p>"Hypertext pioneer Theodor H. Nelson, a contemporary to Kay, argues that the fixed structure of the GUI, and the desktop environment, is harmful in itself as is hides the true nature of the computer from the user. It presents the computer as a black box—and acts as an abstract layer that, rather then helping a person to work well with computers, removes us from what a computational process really is—and more importantly, what it can be."</p>
        <p>"Most household appliances today, be it a washing machine, dishwasher, heating oven or air<br/>conditioning system, are computers. That is, they are CPU-based machines running on a<br/>specialized operating system, with a selection of software particular to its domain of activity."</p>
        <p>"Powerful interfaces, interfaces that define a common ground between man and machine, need<br/>to be founded in an overall conceptual model that considers man-machine interaction in its<br/>totality. The input and response mechanisms of hardware components as well as software<br/>components (operating system and user applications), need to be designed to emphasize the<br/>tasks a user want to perform to reach his goals by interacting with the system."</p>
