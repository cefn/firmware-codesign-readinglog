        Embodiment in General-Purpose Computing</a></h1>
    <h2>Authors</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Dominated by the notion of the embodied 'desktop' or general computing
      interface as it escapes the confines of the WIMP metaphor, illustrated by
      a history of the WIMP metaphor. Introduces and reminds us of a whole host
      of relevant perspectives as it has commonalities with firmware design
      questions. A critical theory sort of paper too. This has been scanned, but
      triggered so many related explorations (e.g. Nelson, Norman) that it
      hasn't been fully assessed.</p>

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"Hypertext pioneer Theodor H. Nelson, a contemporary to Kay, argues that
      the fixed structure of the GUI, and the desktop environment, is harmful in
      itself as is hides the true nature of the computer from the user. It
      presents the computer as a black box—and acts as an abstract layer that,
      rather then helping a person to work well with computers, removes us from
      what a computational process really is—and more importantly, what it can
      be."</p>
    <p>"Most household appliances today, be it a washing machine, dishwasher,
      heating oven or air<br>
      conditioning system, are computers. That is, they are CPU-based machines
      running on a<br>
      specialized operating system, with a selection of software particular to
      its domain of activity."</p>
    <p>"Powerful interfaces, interfaces that define a common ground between man
      and machine, need<br>
      to be founded in an overall conceptual model that considers man-machine
      interaction in its<br>
      totality. The input and response mechanisms of hardware components as well
      as software<br>
      components (operating system and user applications), need to be designed
      to emphasize the<br>
      tasks a user want to perform to reach his goals by interacting with the
      system."</p>
