      Describes Engineering drawings from a boundary objects point of view. £
      Well worth a full read-through, as highly referenced by others.

    <p>
      "The destruction of important situated practices within the visual
      conventions of design activity lies in an<br />
      elementary misunderstanding of both the practices themselves and their
      in-<br />
      teractive character. These fundamental misunderstandings are
      constructed<br />
      into the CAD/CAM system, whose designers assume a linear theory of<br />
      innovation that projects a straightforward process from idea, to drawing,
      to<br />
      prototype, to production...such rigid models are seriously misguided." £
      denies linearity
    </p>
    <p>
      "the very "efficiency" of their intended use dis-integrates<br />
      the social communication practices that normally serve to repair the
      problems<br />
      and misunderstandings that are part of the work process" £ could be said
      of UML for firmware design
