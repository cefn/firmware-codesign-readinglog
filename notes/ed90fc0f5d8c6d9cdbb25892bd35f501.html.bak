        games as a tool, a mindset and a structure</a></h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>A very long (PhD thesis?),&nbsp; not yet read in full. Skipped to section
      on Facilitating Co-Design, in preparation for Manteigas. Discusses
      card-based design games for facilitation, to combine both catalysing ideas
      <em>and</em> documenting them. Can leave some voices unheard, only serve
      some constituencies (e.g. designers). Incident cards and dice.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>Particularisation- defining and explicating all objects in a roleplay,
      Presencing - emphasising the present time in roleplay. Personalisation -
      increasing engagement by incorporating their own objects/elements.
