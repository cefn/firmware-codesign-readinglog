        <p>
      Consider the form of material which can be adopted for a computer as a
      'material without qualities' [credited to Löwgren and Stolterman 1998]

        <p>
      "Design is ‘thinking with materials’, and designers need deep knowledge
      about their materials"
    </p>
        <p>
      "Some even say that the material ‘tells’ the craftsperson what it ‘wants
      to be’ – a particular piece of wood ‘wants to be’ a particular form in a
      chair. Similarly, the craftsperson must have a feeling for how a
      particular idea ‘wants to be’ manifest in a material or be expressed in
      different materials. Design thinking is thus very closely connected with
      the physical world, with the material and with the complex reality – with
      the hand"
    </p>
        <p>
      "The fact that the material is ‘so flexible it almost can take on any
      form we want’ misleads us to see it as ‘immaterial’."
    </p>
        <p>
      "A ‘bricoleur’... uses products and product parts as materials"
    </p>
        <p>
      "As a starting point to explore the possibility of talking about
      processual material, I will use other kinds of processual design results.
      Candidates for such analogies are design results that exist as an
      experiential process; music, theatre, dance or other performances. Design
      of such processes results in descriptions of activities at a very
      detailed level that are used as prescriptions for the concrete
      realization of the performance (see e.g. Larssen et  al. 2004; Loke
      et al. 2007). For all performances there exist notations that can be
      read<br/>
      and interpreted as structure for the process"
    </p>
        <p>
      "Seeing digital design as thinking with concrete abstractions of
      processes, at different levels of concretizations as well as across them,
      suggests that digital designers should understand their material in a way
      that enable them to move between levels of concretization and choose the
      right abstraction for the actual design process as it evolves in time."
    </p>
        <p>
      "it makes sense to characterize processual material as structural
      representations framing processes, emphasizing that it requires knowledge
      to ‘see’ the process when reading the representation. Composers and
      musicians hear the music when reading the scores; dancers and
      choreographers feel the dance when they read the choreography; actors and
      directors experience the story and the characters when reading the
      manuscript or storyboard; programmers see the computational process when
      reading program code and systems designers see the system behaviour when
      reading the system description. Working with processual material thus
      implies working with representations of process abstractions, recognizing
      that the concretization of the process will be formed by the situational
      circumstances" [related to Service Blueprints/UML and representations of
      passage of time and transitions]
