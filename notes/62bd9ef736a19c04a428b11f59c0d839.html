    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;Consider the form of material which can be adopted for a computer
      as a 'material without qualities' [credited to Löwgren and Stolterman
      1998]</p>

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"Design is ‘thinking with materials’, and designers need deep knowledge
      about their materials"</p>
    <p>"Some even say that the material ‘tells’ the craftsperson what it ‘wants
      to be’ – a particular piece of wood ‘wants to be’ a particular form in a
      chair. Similarly, the craftsperson must have a feeling for how a
      particular idea ‘wants to be’ manifest in a material or be expressed in
      different materials. Design thinking is thus very closely connected with
      the physical world, with the material and with the complex reality – with
      the hand"</p>
    <p>"The fact that the material is ‘so flexible it almost can take on any
      form we want’ misleads us to see it as ‘immaterial’."</p>
    <p>"A ‘bricoleur’... uses products and product parts as materials"</p>
    <p>"As a starting point to explore the possibility of talking about
      processual material, I will use other kinds of processual design results.
      Candidates for such analogies are design results that exist as an
      experiential process; music, theatre, dance or other performances. Design
      of such processes results in descriptions of activities at a very detailed
      level that are used as prescriptions for the concrete realization of the
      performance (see e.g. Larssen et&nbsp; al. 2004; Loke et al. 2007). For
      all performances there exist notations that can be read<br>
      and interpreted as structure for the process"</p>
    <p>"Seeing digital design as thinking with concrete abstractions of
      processes, at different levels of concretizations as well as across them,
      suggests that digital designers should understand their material in a way
      that enable them to move between levels of concretization and choose the
      right abstraction for the actual design process as it evolves in time."</p>
