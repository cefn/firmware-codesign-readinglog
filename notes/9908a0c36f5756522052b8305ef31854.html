        <p>Very relevant as they undertake an analysis of ideation tools which parallels our own, but for different domains.</p>
        <h2>Quotations</h2>
        <p>"A multiple case study compared how design students and design<br/>practitioners used conceptual tools in everyday design situations. The<br/>outcome showed that verbalisation, rather than freehand sketching was<br/>the major conceptual tool for getting started. Moreover, the computer<br/>emerged as an ideation tool across design domains."</p>
        <p>"Each interview, which was audio-taped and transcribed,<br/>included the following scripted questions: What conceptual tools did<br/>you use? Where in the design process did you use them? Did you<br/>experience any sudden insights (‘Aha!’), and if so, what conceptual tools<br/>were then used? What were the strengths and weaknesses of the<br/>respective conceptual tools?"<br/>
            <br/>"protocol reliability and validity was built on trustworthiness from a practical and pragmatic<br/>perspective (Silverman, 2001). Moreover, using purposive sampling (Denzin and Lincoln, 1994), the case study did not amount to a survey<br/>and therefore any generalisation would be of an analytical rather than statistical nature (Yin, 2003)."<br/>
