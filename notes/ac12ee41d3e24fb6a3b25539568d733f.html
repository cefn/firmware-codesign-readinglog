        <p>"Diagrams are essential representations for thinking, problem solving, and communication in the<br/>design disciplines, in particular those concerned with making physical form: mechanical and civil<br/>engineering, graphic design, and architecture and physical planning."</p>
        <p>"In architecture, drawings are the primary form of representation; they carry a design from conception to construction. Except<br/>for physical models (which can be considered a kind of three-dimensional drawing) all external<br/>design representations in architecture are drawings."</p>
