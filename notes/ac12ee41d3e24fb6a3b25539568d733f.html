      "Diagrams are essential representations for thinking, problem solving,
      and communication in the<br />
      design disciplines, in particular those concerned with making physical
      form: mechanical and civil<br />
      engineering, graphic design, and architecture and physical planning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In architecture, drawings are the primary form of representation; they
      carry a design from conception to construction. Except<br />
      for physical models (which can be considered a kind of three-dimensional
      drawing) all external<br />
      design representations in architecture are drawings."
