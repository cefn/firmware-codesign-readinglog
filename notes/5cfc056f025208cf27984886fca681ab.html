    <p>"It is argued that IS development should be reframed as a transitional
      space, with particular attention given to the selection of appropriate
      transitional objects to assist in breaking down defensive processes. The
      cases are revisited to illustrate this approach in action; useful insights
      and positive practical outcome"</p>
    <p>"many of the dysfunctions of IS development are due to its inherently
      stressful nature and the adverse impact that this has on participants.
      This stressfulness emanates from the high complexity (technical and
      managerial) of IS projects, that such undertakings typically involve a
      daunting combination of exacting cognitive demands, high levels of risk
      and uncertainty, political strife and the need to accommodate multiple
      stakeholder interests"</p>
    <p>"Normatively speaking, ISD is a process of organizational change in which
      IT systems are designed and deployed to enable more effective operational
      practices. To bring this about, the prevailing business paradigm must be
      questioned with goals, processes, and roles considered afresh in the light
      of new technological potentialities."</p>
    <p>"The present work is concerned with such defensive, antilearning
      processes, and with strategies<br>
      to pre-empt and overcome them in the context of IS development"</p>
