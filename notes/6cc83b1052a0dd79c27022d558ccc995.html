    <p>"For team designing to be effective we rely on team members to support
      each other in answering questions that arise and in picking up<br>
      lines of thought from each other to build on. This should give an added
      value compared to individual designing, where the designer creates<br>
      his/her own private understanding of the design problem and the design
      solution. But by introducing several designers we also introduce the
      difficulties of team designing. These lie in synchronising the thoughts
      and activities of the team members. Judging from team observations this
      can cause serious problems for team members in interactions and
      conversations and lead to misunderstanding and uncoordinated actions."</p>
    <p>"Schon’s theory is based on a constructionist view of human perception
      and<br>
      thought processes: through the execution of ‘move-testing experiments’<br>
      (involving action and reflection), a designer is actively constructing a
      view<br>
      of the world based on his/her experiences....In this paradigm, the basic
      elements of design activities are actions, and<br>
      the kernel of the design ability is to make intelligent decisions about
      those<br>
      actions. The results of these experimental actions are scrutinised by the<br>
      designer, who reacts to this new state of his/her own making. The final<br>
      design is a result of this interaction."</p>
    <p>"The designers start by <em><strong>naming</strong></em> the relevant
      issues in the design situation, <em><strong>framing</strong></em> the
      problem<br>
      in a certain way, <em><strong>making</strong></em> moves towards a
      solution, and <em><strong>reflecting</strong></em> on those<br>
      moves and the current frame.</p>
