    <p>"idea generation typically produces a high ratio of bad ideas to good
      ones, and idea selection mechanisms often function poorly"</p>
    <p>"Brainstorming (Osborn, 1957) is an intervention in which individuals,
      groups, and organizations adhere to a set of four rules while working in
      sessions designated to generate ideas. The rules are (1) to generate as
      many ideas as possible, (2) to avoid criticizing any of the ideas, (3) to
      attempt to combine and improve on previously articulated ideas, and (4) to
      encourage the generation of “wild” ideas."</p>
