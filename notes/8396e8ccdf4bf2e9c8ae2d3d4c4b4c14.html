            <div>In this paper we describe a high profile project to reimagine a large green space in the heart of the city of Lancaster in the UK. This co-design project involved professional designers, but also 2500 people with 700 of these making an active co-design contribution. This project forms the basis of a discussion of how we used a series of events to help participants reach their full creative co-design potential. From this case study we go on to develop a framework of recommendations to help designers reflect on their normal practice and how they need to operate within a co-design project.</div>

        <p>Co-Design is a well-established approach to creative practice, especially in the public sector. It is often used as an umbrella term for participatory, co-creation and open design processes.</p>
        <p>UK Design Council and The European Design Leadership Board...both define co-design as: A community centred methodology that designers use to enable people who will be served by a design outcome to participate in designing solutions to their problems.</p>
