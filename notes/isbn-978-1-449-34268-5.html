    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"Over the last decade, designers have been encouraged to think big, to solve "wicked problems", to use "design thinking" to tackle massive, systemic issues in business and in government... ...But by working at such a macro scale, an important part of design is often lost: the details that delight. Products that we love show an attention to detail: the beautiful curve, the satisfying click, the understandable mental model."</p>
    <p>"Microinteractions can be part of a product - or even the entire product itself. Take a toaster, for example. A toaster does one thing: toasts. It only has one use case: a user puts item to toast into the toaster and presses start. Toaster toasts. Toast pups up when done. That's it....the whole device is powered by one microinteraction."</p>
    <p>"In the mechanical era, users could follow their actions directly from the control to the output. You could pull a lever, watch the gears move and finally see the wheels turn. It was easy to connect the input to the output." [credited to Bill DeRouchey - History of the Button]</p>
    <p>"Users may wan...the understanding of how [system-initiated triggers] operate...they want to know the rules of the microinteraction.</p>
    <p>"Take what is probably the simplest microinteraction there is: turning on a light. Once you use the trigger (a light switch), the light turns on. In a basic light setup there is a single rule: the light stays on and fully lit until the switch is turned off....the basic turn on switch/turn on light rule is very simple, and one that becomes apparent to anyone who uses a light, even a child."</p>
    <p>"Everything we see or hear while using digital devices is an abstraction. Very few of us really know what's happening when we use any kind of software or device...you're not really putting a "file" into a "folder" and "email" isn't really arriving into your "inbox". Those are all metaphors that allow us to understand the interactions that are going on."</p>
    <p>"The last part of microinteractions are the <em>loops</em> and <em>modes</em> that make up its meta rules."</p>
    <p>"Signature moments are those microinteractions that are product differentiators."</p>
    <p>"Manual triggers can also be invisible - there might be no label or affordance to let the user know there's a microinteraction to be triggered. Invisible triggeres are often sensor-based, made possible via touchscreens, cameras, microphones, and other sensors such as accelerometers. </p>
