    <p>"the [design research]...community attempts to understand basic patterns
      of human and social behavior and how technology affects both"</p>
    <p>"we have many myths about the power of design research, brainstorming,
      rapid prototyping, iterative test and design, but zero evidence"</p>
    <p>"even when researchers well versed in experimental methods attempt to
      study practices, they discover the very nature of a practical discipline
      throws in so many idiosyncratic variables that rigor is simply not
      possible"</p>
    <p>"Pasteur...started with a real, practical problem, realized it needed
      some fundamental scientific advances before it could be solved, did the
      science, and then applied it back to the problem. In other words, the
      research was done in search of a solution to a real problem: what Stokes
      calls “use-inspired basic research.”"</p>
