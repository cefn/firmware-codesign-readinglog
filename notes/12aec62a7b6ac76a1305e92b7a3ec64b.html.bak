    <p>"Human factors and design, together with user-centered processes, are
      often taken to be all there is to interaction design, but the hidden
      partner is the details of how things work when they are used. As they say,
      the devil is in the details, and this is a matter of programming."</p>
    <p>"Interactive programs are too complex for unaided human comprehension;
      instead, good user-interface-design requirements must be engineered into
      programs by rigorous, formal processes." [<em><strong>I disagree</strong></em>]</p>
    <p>"If a device “operates as designed,” it is often assumed to be designed
      correctly, even if (to more perceptive eyes) the incident is a symptom of
      bad design, a “system-induced user error.”</p>
    <p>"Why aren’t devices made consistent with best clinical practice, so that
      operator training becomes simpler, rather than the other way around? Why
      does the report say in its recommendation 10A that nurses should be
      trained that “mL” on an infusion pump means “mL per hour”[2]? Why does
      recommendation 10B ask purchasers (hospitals) to do human factors studies
      of pumps? The same answer to both questions is that for the time being
      manufacturers—and national regulatory processes—can’t be relied on, and
      hospitals therefore have to train nurses to cope with bad design."<br>
