    <p>"The central claim of this paper is that organization studies needs<br>
      to be fundamentally reshaped. Such change is needed to provide<br>
      room for ethics and to increase the relevance of research. We<br>
      argue that the new pragmatism provides critical resources for<br>
      this change. Pragmatism is a particularly helpful tool to use in<br>
      that it highlights the moral dimensions of organizing (is this<br>
      useful for our purposes?) while at the same time avoiding en-<br>
      trenched epistemological distinctions that marginalize ethics<br>
      and make research less useful."</p>
    <p>"The new pragmatism (the terms<br>
      "pragmatism" and "the new pragmatism" are used inter-<br>
      changeably) focuses on serving human purposes, and thus<br>
      simultaneously highlights the moral dimensions of orga-<br>
      nizations and the need for research to have practical<br>
      value."</p>
