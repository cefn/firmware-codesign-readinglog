        <p>"The central claim of this paper is that organization studies needs<br/>to be fundamentally reshaped. Such change is needed to provide<br/>room for ethics and to increase the relevance of research. We<br/>argue that the new pragmatism provides critical resources for<br/>this change. Pragmatism is a particularly helpful tool to use in<br/>that it highlights the moral dimensions of organizing (is this<br/>useful for our purposes?) while at the same time avoiding en-<br/>trenched epistemological distinctions that marginalize ethics<br/>and make research less useful."</p>
        <p>"The new pragmatism (the terms<br/>"pragmatism" and "the new pragmatism" are used inter-<br/>changeably) focuses on serving human purposes, and thus<br/>simultaneously highlights the moral dimensions of orga-<br/>nizations and the need for research to have practical<br/>value."</p>
