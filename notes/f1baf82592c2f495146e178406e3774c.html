        <p>"Ambiguity is usually considered anathema in Human Computer Interaction. We argue, in contrast, that it is a resource for design that can be used to encourage close personal engagement with systems."</p>
        <p>"This interpretative relationship is the source of ambiguityâ€™s appeal: by thwarting easy interpretation, ambiguous situations require people to participate in making meaning. This can involve the integration of previously disconnected discourses, the projection of meaning onto an unspecified situation, or the resolution of an ethical dilemma."</p>
        <p>"A number of tactics may be used to enhance ambiguity of information. These focus on creating or reflecting uncertainties about information that are in some way significant.</p>
        <p>...Use imprecise representations to emphasise uncertainty.</p>
        <p>...Over-interpret data to encourage speculation.</p>
        <p>...Expose inconsistencies to create a space of interpretation.</p>
        <p>...Cast doubt on sources to provoke independent assessment.</p>
        <p>"Blocking the interpretation of a product or system in terms of an established discourse creates ambiguity of context. This is useful in spurring people to approach a particular system with an open mind, and more generally to question the assumptions they have about technological genres.</p>
        <p>...Implicate incompatible contexts to disrupt preconceptions.</p>
        <p>...Add incongruous functions to breach existing genres.</p>
        <p>...Block expected functionality to comment on familiar products."</p>
        <p>"Ambiguity of relationship creates the condition for a deeply personal projection of imagination and values onto a design.</p>
        <p>...Offer unaccustomed roles to encourage imagination.</p>
        <p>...Point out things without explaining why.</p>
        <p>...Introduce disturbing side effects to question responsibility."</p>
        <p>"The most important benefit of ambiguity, however, is the ability it gives designers to suggest issues and perspectives for consideration without imposing solutions. Ambiguity of information impels people to question for themselves the truth of a situation. Contextual ambiguity can question the discourses surrounding technological genres, allowing people to expand, bridge, or reject them as they see fit. Relational ambiguity, finally, can lead people to consider new beliefs and values, and ultimately their own attitudes. In each of these cases, ambiguity frees users to react to designs with scepticism or belief, appropriating systems into their own lives through their interpretations. In the process of reacting to the system either positively or negatively, however, users engage with issues that the designer suggests. Thus ambiguity is a powerful design tool for raising topics or asking questions, while renouncing the possibility of dictating answers. By virtue of this balance, ambiguity both offers an inspiring resource to designers and shows a deep respect for users."<br/>
