      "This paper reports on two studies in which teams of two or three trainee
      designers evaluated a user interface by observing a user working through
      some set tasks . These users were instructed to think aloud as they
      worked ."
    </p>
        <p>
      "In our version of the think aloud method (Wright and Monk 1989), the
      users are told to think of themselves as co-evaluators of the system .
      They are occasionally asked questions such as What will the system do if.
      . . .?, Why did you do that ? When the user asks questions, about what to
      do next for example, the evaluator asks further questions of the user to
      find out about their understanding of the operations available, their
      interpretation of screen and so on . We call this 'co-operative
      evaluation'."
