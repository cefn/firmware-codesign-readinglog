        <p>"interaction design is about more than designing a user interface; it’s about designing interaction between users and artifacts."</p>
        <p>"Interaction design is a relatively young field without well-developed conventions, tools, and formalisms. We analyze the practical work and the conduct of interaction designers in how they express interaction and dynamics through white board drawings. We focus on how<br/>talk and action were used to shape the meaning of the drawings."</p>
        <p>"The qualities of a design material need to be understood in relation to the activity in which it is taken into use and through the kinds of actions that the participants engage in. This implies that design representations do not carry meaning in themselves but are made meaningful through design activity"</p>
        <p>"The challenging issues that we address here are concerned with understanding the practical means of expressing interaction and how static drawings and sketches actually become to be about the design of interaction."</p>
        <p>"We argue that the drawings and sketches as such are not sketches of interaction, rather they become about interaction through the designers active engagement with these representations through talk and action."</p>
        <p>"Whereas traditional user interface design is concerned with designing the particular interface elements that will be used to interact with a computational system, commonly through WIMP-interfaces, interaction design puts its emphasis on the design of the interaction between users and computational artifacts."</p>
        <p>"The role of sketching is increasingly emphasized in interaction design practice [4, 12] often drawing on Schön’s [13] classic work on how the design material works as a conversational partner that “talks back” to the designer."</p>
