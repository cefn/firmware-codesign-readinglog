    <p>"interaction design is about more than designing a user interface; it’s
      about designing interaction between users and artifacts."</p>
    <p>"Interaction design is a relatively young field without well-developed
      conventions, tools, and formalisms. We analyze the practical work and the
      conduct of interaction designers in how they express interaction and
      dynamics through white board drawings. We focus on how<br>
      talk and action were used to shape the meaning of the drawings."</p>
    <p>"The qualities of a design material need to be understood in relation to
      the activity in which it is taken into use and through the kinds of
      actions that the participants engage in. This implies that design
      representations do not carry meaning in themselves but are made meaningful
      through design activity"</p>
    <p>"The challenging issues that we address here are concerned with
      understanding the practical means of expressing interaction and how static
      drawings and sketches actually become to be about the design of
      interaction."</p>
    <p>"We argue that the drawings and sketches as such are not sketches of
      interaction, rather they become about interaction through the designers
      active engagement with these representations through talk and action."</p>
    <p>"Whereas traditional user interface design is concerned with designing
      the particular interface elements that will be used to interact with a
      computational system, commonly through WIMP-interfaces, interaction design
      puts its emphasis on the design of the interaction between users and
      computational artifacts."</p>
    <p>"The role of sketching is increasingly emphasized in interaction design
      practice [4, 12] often drawing on Schön’s [13] classic work on how the
      design material works as a conversational partner that “talks back” to the
      designer."</p>
