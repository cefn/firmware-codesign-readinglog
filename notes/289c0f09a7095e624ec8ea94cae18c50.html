        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>This addresses strict 'computer science' in the sense of algorithm and device design, and bemoans the lack of mathematical grounding in formal methods, bad science (from the point of view of experiment design).</p>
        <p>I find the scope of this paper unstated, unclear and confusing. The author doesn't identify himself with any specific discipline within Software Engineering, meaning the colleagues he's addressing might be from anywhere from Mathematical logic to STSS.<br/>
            <br/>Superficially this would be relevant to my field, but seems to be discussing software engineering rather than requirements capture or design, and seems to overlook both amazingly when scoping the extent of relevance of empirical study.<br/>
