      "Artefacts drive design. Sketches, props, samples, mock-ups, prototypes,
      objet-trouvé – capture and embody ideas; they represent, translate,
      inspire, and shape the often evasive artefact-under-design; they
      facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration by both, fostering collective
      imaginations and giving concrete form or anchors to flighty and highly
      complex ideas; they help communicate the outcomes of design efforts."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Artefacts-in-context highlight the inseparability of social, cultural
      and material practices and the objects we design and design with."
