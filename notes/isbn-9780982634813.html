    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>A visual guide (short dictionary) of reference terms for interaction
      designers. Tesler's law of conservation of complexity is extremely
      relevant in describing how behaviour is mapped to affordances within a
      firmware-controlled product.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Design patterns and pattern language (credited to architect Christopher
      Alexander) are possibly relevant to modelling firmware.</p>
    <p>Flowcharts should be assessed specifically as a model (perhaps the most
      naive suggestion of a suitable boundary object).</p>
    <p>Cognitive load theory worth examining...(Miller's Magic Number)</p>
