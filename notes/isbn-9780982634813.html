        <h2>Authors</h2>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>A visual guide (short dictionary) of reference terms for interaction designers. Tesler's law of conservation of complexity is extremely relevant in describing how behaviour is mapped to affordances within a firmware-controlled product.</p>
        <p>Design patterns and pattern language (credited to architect Christopher Alexander) are possibly relevant to modelling firmware.</p>
        <p>Flowcharts should be assessed specifically as a model (perhaps the most naive suggestion of a suitable boundary object).</p>
        <p>Cognitive load theory worth examining...(Miller's Magic Number)</p>
