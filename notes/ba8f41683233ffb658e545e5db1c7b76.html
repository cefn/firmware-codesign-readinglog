        <h2>Authors</h2>
        <p>Larry Tesler</p>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>Tesler worked at Xerox Parc credited for early work on thinking about appropriate implementations of functions, e.g. avoiding complex modes [his numberplate is NOMODES]. He went on to lead some important work at Apple</p>

        <p>"Findings from my early studies at Xerox PARC showed that modes were very difficult for people to deal with.<br/>People were always getting into the wrong mode and did not know how to get back out."</p>
        <p>"even an idea that seems elegant and that satisfies some principle is not necessarily going to succeed. The only way to find out is to test it."</p>
        <p>"To make the tests of maximum benefit to the<br/>designers, there are certain rules we try to<br/>follow:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Don't offer help too soon;</li>
            <li>Welcome suggestions and reactions;</li>
            <li>Observe but don't pressure"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>"Even if the subject makes an obvious statement, a trivial remark, or suggests something tha% is impossible to do on a computer, it is important to welcome his reactions and discuss them as an equal."</p>
        <p>"We start out asking open questions. "Well, what do you think?" or "What was hard; what was easy?" Later we pose more direct questions like "The<br/>time you made that certain error, what were you thinking?" or "What do you think is a better term for this concept?" Usually in the open-question stage we get some really good responses that are unexpected. The directed questions address more specific issues."</p>
        <p>"Occasionally, some user's unique quirk may be worth memtioning~ but what is of most concern is what most or all users experienced."</p>
        <p>"Some people think they can design friendly software just by being clever or by reading papers on principles of user interface design.</p>
