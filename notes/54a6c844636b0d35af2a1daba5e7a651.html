        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>They argue that features themselves are not sufficiently rich representations, but mapping user stories to features allows fine-grained implementation questions to be answered. They report on a case study, which is oriented around the choice of line protocol for dispatching structured information between two systems. The emphasis is on a metric of 'compression' and the fact that there are many dimensions and inconsistent test results which can only be picked apart by appeal to stories.</p>

        <h2>Quotations</h2>
        <p>"We argue that features carry a relatively small amount of semantics, if any at all, and that much of the intended semantics remain implicit in naming conventions, or tacit in experience, or undocumented in hearsay. We suggest that the missing semantics, addressing fine-grained questions of context, interface, function, performance, and rationale, can be usefully conveyed through stories attached to features."</p>
        <p>"There are several attributes that make something a story, but one of the key attributes is that of being situated. In a story, context is<br/>(almost) everything." [Suggests context would have to be carried by my proposed boundary objects]</p>
        <p>"User feedback contributions, despite their unstructured form, tend to be highly situated and, thus, are often good examples of the notion of story we are advocating."</p>
        <p>"stories can be used systematically to enrich the semantics of a feature model. At the core of this vision lies interplay between the formal and the informal."</p>
