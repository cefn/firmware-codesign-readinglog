        <p>"Design activities can be seen as the reasoning from a set of needs,<br/>requirements and intentions to a new bit of reality, consisting of a<br/>(physical) structure and an intended use. This process of reasoning is<br/>non-deductive: there is no closed pattern of reasoning to connect the<br/>needs, requirements and intentions with a form of an artifact and a mode<br/>of use. This ‘openness’ of a design problem is called the<br/>underdetermination of design problems."</p>
