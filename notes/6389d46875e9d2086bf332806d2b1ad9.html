      "Design activities can be seen as the reasoning from a set of
      needs,<br />
      requirements and intentions to a new bit of reality, consisting of
      a<br />
      (physical) structure and an intended use. This process of reasoning
      is<br />
      non-deductive: there is no closed pattern of reasoning to connect
      the<br />
      needs, requirements and intentions with a form of an artifact and a
      mode<br />
      of use. This ‘openness’ of a design problem is called the<br />
      underdetermination of design problems."
