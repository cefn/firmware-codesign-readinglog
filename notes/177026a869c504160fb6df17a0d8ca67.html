    <p>"The findings suggest that design and engineering is constructed through
      the interactions of multiple actors, and that artefacts and
      representations of the design process have a key function in the
      organisation of this work."</p>
    <p>"researchers have made proposals on specifications and architectures for<br>
      computer systems to support engineering design. Such applications
      identified as<br>
      facilitating co-located or distributed design work include: shared screen
      (whiteboard),<br>
      shared editor, designer's notepad, videoconference, intelligent agents for
      conflict<br>
      detection, issue based information system (IBIS), work-flow management,
      people<br>
      locators and awareness system, and virtual meeting room."</p>
    <p>"A growing number of<br>
      ethnographic reports suggest that design work depends on ongoing and
      subtle social<br>
      interactions, and on transformation work involving design artefacts. This
      evolving,<br>
      agonistic process , is in our view, not easily improved by new information<br>
      technology. Along with others, we suggest that a deeper understanding of
      the<br>
      limitations of proposed technology can be gained by examining the social
      and<br>
      interactional dimensions of design work. Failure to do this could result
      in the design<br>
      of inappropriate or ineffective technologies, or the implementation of
      counter-<br>
      productive procedures and technologies." [multiple inline refs removed]</p>
