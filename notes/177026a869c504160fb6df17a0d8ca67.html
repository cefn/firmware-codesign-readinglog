        <p>"The findings suggest that design and engineering is constructed through the interactions of multiple actors, and that artefacts and representations of the design process have a key function in the organisation of this work."</p>
        <p>"researchers have made proposals on specifications and architectures for<br/>computer systems to support engineering design. Such applications identified as<br/>facilitating co-located or distributed design work include: shared screen (whiteboard),<br/>shared editor, designer's notepad, videoconference, intelligent agents for conflict<br/>detection, issue based information system (IBIS), work-flow management, people<br/>locators and awareness system, and virtual meeting room."</p>
        <p>"A growing number of<br/>ethnographic reports suggest that design work depends on ongoing and subtle social<br/>interactions, and on transformation work involving design artefacts. This evolving,<br/>agonistic process , is in our view, not easily improved by new information<br/>technology. Along with others, we suggest that a deeper understanding of the<br/>limitations of proposed technology can be gained by examining the social and<br/>interactional dimensions of design work. Failure to do this could result in the design<br/>of inappropriate or ineffective technologies, or the implementation of counter-<br/>productive procedures and technologies."
