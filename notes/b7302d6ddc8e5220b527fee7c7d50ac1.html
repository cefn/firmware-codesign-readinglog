        <h2>Quotations</h2>
        <p>"The focus on technologies-in-practice also allows an examination of the extent to which users realize designers' intentions for a technology....It has long been recognized that technologies are often not used as designed or intended (Bijker 1995, von Hippel 1988), but generating an adequate understanding of how, where, and why the slippage between design and use occurs in practice has been difficult. By distinguishing between technologies as artifacts and technologies-in-practice, we have a way to explore and explain this process."</p>
        <p>"The first type of enactment may be characterized in terms of<strong>
                <em>inertia</em>
            </strong>, where users choose to use technology to retain their existing way of doing things...The second type of enactment may be characterized in terms of<strong>
                <em>application</em>
            </strong>, where people choose to use the new technology to augment or refine their existing ways of doing things...The third type of enactment may be characterized in terms of<em>
                <strong>change</strong>
            </em>, where people choose to use the new technology to substantially alter their existing way of doing things"</p>
        <p>"future research could benefit from attending more carefully to the meanings and emotional attachments that users develop for the technologies they use."</p>
        <p>"By not examining or understanding what actually happens during use of technology, researchers and managers miss the crucial point, that it is whether and how people interact with technology in their day-to-day activities-not the mere presence of the technology on the desktop or factory floor-that influences performance outcomes and consequences."</p>
        <p>"These structures of technology use (technologies-in-practice) are not fixed or given, but constituted and reconstituted through the<br/>everyday, situated practices of particular users using particular technologies in particular circumstances. By attending to such ongoing (re)constitution, a practice lens entails the examination of emergence, improvisation, and change over time as people reconfigure their technologies or alter their habits of use, and thereby enact different technologies-in-practice."</p>
