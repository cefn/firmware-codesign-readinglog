        <p>"The problems of designing large software systems were studied through interviewing personnel from 17 large projects. layered behavioral model is used to analyze how three of these problems--the thin spread of application domain knowledge, fluctuating and conflicting requirements, and communication bottlenecks and breakdowns--affected software productivity and quality through their impact on cognitive, social, and organizational processes."</p>
        <p>"We focused on how requirements and design decisions were made, represented, communicated, and changed, as well as how these decisions impacted subsequent development processes."</p>
        <p>"The layered behavioral model is an abstraction for organizing the behavioral analysis of large software projects. It encourages thinking about a software project as a system with multiple levels of analysis...encourages researchers to extend their evaluation of software engineering practices from individuals to teams and projects, to determine if the aggregate individual level impacts scale-up to an impact on programming-in-the-large."</p>
