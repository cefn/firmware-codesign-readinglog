        <p>"Interaction design research is a unique discipline embracing practicing professionals, design educators, and academic researchers, but attracting attention from people with different backgrounds and interests has lead to the question of what constitutes ‘good research’. What is rigorous and relevant interaction design research and how do we recognise and evaluate it?"</p>
        <p>"Inexperienced researchers and students going into interaction design research tend to find the choice and use of research methods quite overwhelming and difficult."</p>
        <p>"Taken together, at least on the surface or as seen from other disciplines, interaction design research seems to lack rigour."</p>
        <p>"A substantial amount of effort in interaction design research has been focused on developing new theoretical approaches, methods, tools and techniques intended to support interaction designers in their practice."</p>
        <p>"one of the main reasons for having the discussion on rigor and relevance in the first place is the perceived need to establish the field academically while at the same time be practitioner oriented" [credited to Robey and Marcus 1998]</p>
        <p>"in...interpretative –qualitative research, the researcher has an active and thus by definition non-objective role in collecting the data and interpreting what is going on in a certain situation"</p>
        <p>"For instance, it appears very unlikely that two design researchers would come up with the same outcome even in the improbable case that they are provided exactly equal settings, materials, tools, users, etc. One could even argue that a specific quality and value of design research is its ‘unreliability’ and ‘invalidity’, manifested in creativity, innovation and different ways of seeing. Hence, in some situations, validity and reliability in its traditional sense might not even be desirable." [should raise discussion with Joe on this one]</p>
        <p>"Fallman’s (2008) model is a triangle that presents a two-dimensional space for plotting the position of a design research activity drawn up in between three extremes: design practice, design studies and design exploration."</p>
        <p>"each of the three forms of research has its own approach, outcomes, methods and internal logic. Rather, when it comes to the question of what constitutes rigorous and relevant research in interaction design, we suggest that the most important difference between the three research forms is that they have different purposes. The purpose of each approach determines what methods and techniques are useful."</p>
        <p>"The process of design exploration should open up a critical and creative approach that challenges mainstream assumptions in design...This means that rigour can only be measured in relation to how well the approach does open up a design space and less how that is done."</p>
        <p>"We argue that reviewers often come to apply the wrong notions of rigour and relevance to a particular research effort by not taking into consideration what form of research it is."<br/>
