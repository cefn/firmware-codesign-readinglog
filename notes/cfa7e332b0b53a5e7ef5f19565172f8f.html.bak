        pictures mean? Guidelines for experimental evaluation of representation
        fidelity in diagrammatical conceptual modeling techniques</a></h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Cover experimental materials supporting 'conceptual modeling' in systems
      analysis and design, substantiated by 'meaningful tests of domain
      semantics' - "research aimed at empirically evaluating ... diagrammatic
      notations... to convey semantics of a real world domain". They contrast
      'read' tasks and 'write' tasks in experiments, and focus on 'read' tasks.
    </p>
    <p>They focus on formal validity questions, e.g. controlled variables in
      subject selection, choice of lab versus ex-lab. Four contrasting
      experimental design aspects are highlighted, independent variables, <strong><em>dependent
          measures, participants and procedures</em></strong>.</p>
    <p>Recommend 'informational equivalence' so that the semantic delivery of
      different representations. They see dependent measures, such as a test of
      competence which combines knowledge represented with prior knowledge, to
      be problematic. They point out that Subject Matter Experts must not be
      used, though they accept this undermines external validity! [a
      methodological challenge for CDPF?]</p>
