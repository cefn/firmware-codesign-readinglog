    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>The design of boundary objects for bricolage has some strong resonances
      with the use of Cultural Probes as an open-ended, expressive and
      materials-mediated form of communication exchange as part of a design
      process. However, we differ with "we didn't want the groups to constrain
      our designs unduly", as this is exactly what we want - to be constrained.</p>

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"We wanted to lead a discussion with the groups toward unexpected ideas,
      but we didn’t want to dominate it."</p>
    <p>"Unlike formal questionnaires, the postcards encouraged questions to be
      approached casually, which was underlined by pre-addressing and stamping
      them for separate return." [suggests some softer dimensions of designing
      for bricolage - what cues with the participants get and how will that
      condition their creating?]</p>
    <p>"Unlike much research, we don’t emphasize precise analyses or carefully
      controlled methodologies; instead, we concentrate on aesthetic control,
      the cultural implications of our designs, and ways to open new spaces for
      design."</p>
