    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"The motivation of the present work is to make a contribution to user
      interface design, specifically to discuss ways of measuring usability from
      design, from specifications rather than implementations."</p>
    <p>"Ideally, of course, user interfaces should be empirically evaluated and
      then improved, but in practice many products are designed and then fobbed
      off to users, with little opportunity for improvements."</p>
    <p>"This paper suggests treating user interfaces as finite state machines,
      and using graph theory as an analytic framework. The approach is not
      contentious, but means that many (even obvious) faults in user interfaces
      will not be addressed."</p>
    <p>"although there may be a direct way to give the user a model, doing so
      can be assumed to interfere with the user's task"</p>
    <p>"we may be safe in assuming that the larger the length of a complete
      manual is, the less usable the system"</p>
    <p>"much complexity arises from pedantry in what we wish to describe. If
      users can be assumed to understand the numbers involved in times, then we
      do not need to describe every possible change of time: instead all times
      can be treated equivalently. The alarm clock becomes about 3 augmented
      states."</p>
    <p>"We have argued that very many direct measures of usability can be
      obtained at design time. These measures have to be used judiciously, but
      they are easy to obtain and give direct indicators of usability."</p>
