    <p>"In this thesis I argue for a new type of interface that combines some of
      the advantages of mechanical systems with the abstract computational power
      of modern computers. Software-based computation is merged with dynamic
      physical processes that are exposed to and modified by the user in order
      to accomplish his or her task."</p>
