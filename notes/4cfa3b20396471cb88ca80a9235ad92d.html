        ignorance, social creativity, and meta-design</a></h1>

    <h2>Relevance</h2>
    <p>Fischer is a key writer about meta-design; "designing for design", which
      intersects strongly with the problem of creating assets and learning
      trajectories for co-design workshops. This is an incredibly resonant paper
      for my work, given that it connects to co-design, but also design of
      software, the externalisation of constraints and in particular the
      externalisation through computational critics (automated problem-finding
      processes).</p>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"Complex design problems require more knowledge than any one single
      person can possess, and the knowledge relevant to a problem is<br>
      often distributed and controversial."</p>
    <p>"Rather than being a limiting factor, 'symmetry of ignorance' can provide
      the foundation for social creativity."</p>
    <p>"Social creativity can be supported by new media that allow owners of
      problems to contribute to framing and solving these problems."</p>
    <p>"the activity or the product is not necessarily novel or original to a
      community of practice or society as a whole - but psychological, meaning
      it is personally novel and meaningful to the stakeholders who produced it"</p>
    <p>"This paper explores three interrelated concepts: symmetry of ignorance,
      social creativity, and meta-design"</p>
    <p>"The predominant activity in designing complex systems is that
      participants teach and instruct each other."</p>
    <p>"Because complex problems require more knowledge than any single person
      possesses, communication and collaboration among<br>
      all the involved stakeholders are necessary; for example, domain experts
      understand the practice, and system designers know the technology."</p>
    <p>"In order to bring important perspectives to the process of design, all
      stakeholders in the process should be designers and co-developers, not
      just consumers."</p>
    <p>"End-users, as owners of problems, bring special perspectives to
      collaborative design activities that are of special importance for the
      framing of problems."</p>
    <p>"approaches ...that view learning as collaborative knowledge construction
      [are] in sharp contrast to the teaching cultures of our schools, by which
      teaching is often fitted into a mold in which a single, presumably
      omniscient teacher explicitly tells or shows presumably unknowing learners
      something they presumably know nothing about"</p>
    <p>"a human coach, a design critic, or a teacher can help the learner to
      identify the breakdown situation and to provide task-relevant information
      for reflection" £</p>
    <p>"In our own work, we have explored the possibility of using computational
      critics to provide some of this support when humans are not present.
      Critics make argumentation serve design; this is, they support learners in
      their own activities." £</p>
    <p>"Mutual competency supported by objects-to-think-with (externalization of
      ideas, concepts, and goals), leads to settings and opportunities for
      learning by all participants." £ especially the concept of
      objects-to-think-with</p>
    <p>"Empowering individuals requires conceptual frameworks and computational
      environments that will give domain designers more independence from
      computer specialists. Past L 3 D research has developed conceptual
      frameworks to empower individuals by developing domain-oriented design
      environments (DODEs) [20], which make the computer invisible, and bringing
      tasks to the forefront in a variety of different domains. By being
      domain-oriented, they support (1) breakdowns, (2) critics, and (3)
      learning on demand." <span style="text-decoration: underline;">£ esp
        'domain-oriented', and 'independence from computer specialists'</span></p>
    <p>"Learning on demand ...is a promising approach to supporting creativity
      for the following reasons: (1) it contextualizes learning by allowing it
      to be integrated into work rather than relegating it to a separate phase;
      (2) it lets learners see for themselves the usefulness of new<br>
      knowledge for actual problem situations, thereby increasing the motivation
      for learning new skills and information; and<br>
      (3) it makes new information relevant to the task at hand, thereby leading
      to better decision making, better products, and better performance." </p>
    <p>"Distributed cognition emphasizes that the heart of intelligent human
      performance is not the individual human mind but (1) groups of minds in
      interaction with each other or (2) minds in interactions with tools and
      artifacts."</p>
    <p>"Externalizations: (1) create a record of our mental efforts, one that is
      "outside us" rather than vaguely in memory; and (2) represent situations
      that can talk back to us and form the basis for critique and negotiation."</p>
    <p>"The ability to interact with the problem at hand and to have that
      situation 'talk back' is a crucial mode of design."<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
    <p>the effort required to contribute to organizational memory must be
      minimal so it will not interfere with performing the work at hand" £

    <p>"Meta-design characterizes activities, processes, and objectives to
      create new media and environments that allow users to act as designers and
      be creative."</p>
    <p>"A feasible design strategy to support users in their own domain of
      knowledge is that system designers make assumptions about classes of users
      and sets of tasks in which they want to engage - a design methodology
      leading to domain-oriented systems"</p>
    <p>"A necessary, but not sufficient condition for meta-design is that
      software systems must have features that permit users to create
      customizations and extensions"</p>
    <p>"The EDC is a meta-design approach with the goal of creating environments
      that are immersive and emergent. An immersive environment allows
      stakeholders to become deeply engaged in problem solving in the context of
      information, action, re &#772;ection, and collaborations relevant to the
      situation, whereas an emergent environment addresses the need for this
      context to grow and evolve based on ongoing problem-solving activities.
      These intertwined concepts require the EDC to support stakeholders in (1)
      creating and capturing knowledge in the context of collaborative design
      activities; (2) sustaining the timeliness and utility of evolving
      information; (3) articulating their own knowledge in a form that other
      people can understand; (4) enhancing existing knowledge with new
      knowledge; and (5) creating tools that help stakeholders think, and help
      analyze their constructions and artifacts."</p>
    <p>"The action space of the EDC is built using AgentSheets [37], a software
      environment for creating simulations and domain-oriented environments.
      AgentSheets applications include a collection of autonomous computational
      processes, called agents, that are comprised of a look (their on-screen
      representation), and a programmed behavior. Agents in AgentSheets are
      programmed in Visual AgenTalk, a programming environment suitable for
      end-user programmers."</p>
    <p>"Meta-design is supported by the seeding, evolutionary growth, reseeding
      model" £ follow up reference here.</p>
    <p>"Failing to make computation accessible with reasonable cognitive costs
      to all people will reduce people's creativity. Furthermore, it will
      prevent the emergence of computational environments that need to evolve
      through the active contributions from their users."<br>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>This paper refers to a number of co-design workshop events supported with
      a "Domain-Oriented design environment" - a computational infrastructure to
      support reflection for different design domains. An example cited is a
      system for stakeholders to assign buses to routes in Boulder, Colorado
      (where the research team are based). These are domain-specific tools which
      support participants by allowing them to learn fundamentals about the
      problem, as well as learn perspectives from others, by externalising their
      thinking into a computer-supported scratch space which embodies the
      problem landscape. The authors assert that a single individual cannot be
      expected to have insight into all the important aspects of a real-world
      design, demanding that specific effort is invested in creating the
      conditions for exchange and consolidation of multiple stakeholders'
      insights. Designing for sharing within a design workshop helps others who
      have complementary knowledge (hence 'symmetry of ignorance') to engage
      with and collaborate over each others issues of concern. The computer
      supported design environment helps to make constraints from the domain
      explicit as part of participants' design exploration, (such as how quickly
      buses can get around, for example), which are implemented through
      simulated computational entities (having behaviours of their own, crafted
      to reflect the domain). </p>
    <p>This paper reads like a position paper, which introduces key phrases, but
      relates them to a thread of research activity which is presented without a
      great deal of implementation detail. In general the authors are agitating
      for acknowledgement of meta-design as a recognised field of design, in
      which environments are crafted to help others engage in design through
      'social creativity' and 'collaborative knowledge construction'. In
      particular they recognise the creative value of 'breakdowns' in which
      expectations cannot be achieved because of constraints in the domain, and
      rely on 'objects-to-think-with' to surface these breakdowns in a way that
      participants can address them.</p>
    <p>The particular approach they recommend might apply very well to
      agent-oriented systems such as public-transport networks, in which each
      vehicle can be presented as an agent with simulated/programmed behaviour.
      This suggests that the approach only applies to a narrow set of domains,
      where this encoding of agent behaviours is feasible/comprehensible. This
      very important question is not explored within the paper.</p>

    <p>Discusses the relevance of learning as a creative dimension (and
      epistemic learning/creativity relative to the participants pre-existing
      knowledge being relevant, not just new learning as a species).</p>
    <p>Introduces "critiquing systems" as a mechanism for domain-specific
      reflection-in-action.</p>

      design methods" (from Cross' edited Developments in Design Methodology).</p>
