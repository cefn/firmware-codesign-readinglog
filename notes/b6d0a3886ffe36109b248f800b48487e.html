    <p>
      Considers the metaphysics of analysing sociomaterial entanglements, and
      whether the metaphor of tiling or imbrication is better - stuck together
      like a puzzle, looking like one thing from far off, but rather revealed
      to be separate things - social and material, when the analysis is close
      up, and benefits from this distinction.

      "re-focusing attention on the materiality of the tools with which people
      work—is especially important if one wishes to take a design orientation
      to organizational analysis. By design orientation we mean conducting
      research that not only allows us to describe organizational processes,
      but to generate insights about how to improve them"

      "the metaphor of imbrication becomes a useful alternative to the metaphor
      of entanglement (Leonardi 2011). The verb “to imber” derives from a kind
      of Greek and Roman tile, known as imbrex (from imber, “rain”), used in
      combination with other kind of tile called “tegula”. Imbrices were laid
      out so that one slightly overlapped the next one, in the same way as the
      scales of a fish, thereby channeling the rain over the tegulae, and off
      the roof. In the same way as imbrices and tegulae differ in their
      constituent make-up, so too do social and material agencies. “Though both
      [are] capabilities for action, [they] differ phenomenologically with
      respect to intention. Thus, like the tegula and the imbrex, they have
      distinct contours and through their imbrication they come to form an
      integrated organizational structure” (Leonardi 2011, p. 37)."
