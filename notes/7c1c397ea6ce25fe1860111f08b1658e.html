        <h2>Quotations</h2>
        <p>"This paper defines an information systems design theory (ISDT) to be a prescriptive theory which integrates normative and descriptive theories into design paths intended to produce more effective information systems"</p>
        <p>"The IS discipline needs to articulate and develop a class of "design theories". A design theory is a prescriptive theory based on theoretical underpinnings which says how a design process can be carried out in a way which is both effective and feasible. Since they are prescriptive, design theories differ from explanatory and predictive theories found in the natural or physical sciences."</p>
