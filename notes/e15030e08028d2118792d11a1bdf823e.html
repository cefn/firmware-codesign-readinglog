      "As a technique for opening ideas about rich forms of interaction with
      electronic products, we have experimented with interaction relabelling.
      In this method, participants are asked to consider an existing product,
      and, pretending that it is the product to be designed, to tell and act
      out how it works."
    </p>
        <p>
      "The ‘hands-on’ nature of interaction relabelling enables participants to
      come up with novel ideas about interaction which are different from those
      which emerge from market research, literature studies, traditional
      brainstorming techniques or sketching. A different choice of object
      highlights different interaction possibilities. Relabelling a simple
      object, such as a stapler, forces designers to think in equally simple
      actions for the product to be designed, while choosing a complex object,
      such as a Swiss Army knife, allows them to think of a more gadget-like
      product."<br/>
            <br/>
      "Designing for extreme characters is a technique which tries to steer
      away from the usual designing for a prototypical character from a target
      group. In fact, it takes the opposite approach. Instead of designing for
      characters that are emotionally shallow, we design for characters that
      have exaggerated emotional attitudes. In his project, Frens designed for
      three extreme characters: a drugsdealer, the Pope and a polyandrous
      twenty-year old."<br/>
