        <p>"Assessments of change, dynamics and cause and effect are at the heart of thinking and explanation. To understand is to know<em>what cause provokes what effect, by what means, at what rate.</em>How then is such knowledge to be represented? This book describes design strategies - the proper arrangement in space and time of images, words and numbers - for presenting information about motion, process, mechanism, cause and effect. These strategies are found again and again in portrayals of explanations, quite independent of the particular substantive content or technology of display."</p>
        <p>"When principles of design replicate principles of though, the act of arranging information becomes an act of insight." Â£</p>
        <p>"Visual Explanations is about<em>pictures of verbes</em>, the representation of mechanism and motion, of process and dynamics, of causes and effects, of explanation and narrative. Since such displays are often used to reach conclusions and make decisions, there is a special concern with the integrity of the content and the design."</p>
        <p>"maps resemble miniature pictorial representations of the physical world"</p>
        <p>"Huygens presents a series of still images in order to depict motion. To resolve such discontinuous spatial representations of continuous temporal activity, viewers must interpolate between images, closing up the gaps."</p>
        <p>"Muybridge shows 18 separate photographs to capture a few seconds of leapfrog."</p>
        <p>"space replaces time as the sequencing dimension. The adjacency of images helps us to assess change and possibly rates of change within each image and between images in sequence - and we can do so at our own pace."</p>
        <p>"Sequences of still images suffer the obvious...loss of the experience of the passage of time, the loss of the rates and rhythms of actual motion."</p>
        <p>"Illustrations of postage-stamp size are indexed by a category or a label, sequenced in time like the frames of a movie, or gathered along a fresh dimension not contained in each small element. For a broad range of problems in presenting numbers and images, small multiples will serve quite well. Since many slices of information are displayed within the eyespan, alert viewers may be able to detect contrasts and correspondences at a glance - uninterrupted visual reasoning. And some multiples, like good graphics of all kinds, are worth more than a glance; careful viewing may reveal subtle differences among the elements."</p>
        <p>"...too many computer displays, where a crampted window showing the user's work is framed by a bureaucratic debris of scroll bards, buttons, titles, icons and over-produced drawings</p>
        <p>"ideally structures that organize information should be transparent, straightforward, obvious, natural, ordinary, conventional - with no need for hesitation or questioning on the part of the reader."</p>
