    <p>"Designers need insight in the diverse contexts surrounding a
      product's&nbsp;use, and especially within the field of participatory
      design, a number of techniques&nbsp;have emerged to more widely explore
      the user's life than had been customary in&nbsp;traditional,
      function-centered design"</p>
    <p>"In the design development process, generative methods such as
      collaging&nbsp;<br>
      can be used together with other methods in a converging perspectives
      approach&nbsp;<br>
      (Sanders, 2000) that draws simultaneously from three perspectives:
      marketing&nbsp;<br>
      research (“what people say”), applied anthropology (“what people do”)
      and&nbsp;<br>
      participatory design (“what people make”). When all three perspectives
      are&nbsp;<br>
      explored simultaneously, we can understand the experience domains of the
      people&nbsp;<br>
      we are serving through design. When we bring these people through
      guided&nbsp;<br>
      discovery and give them the generative make tools, we have set the stage
      for them&nbsp;<br>
      to express their own creative ideas. "</p>
