      "Designers need insight in the diverse contexts surrounding a
      product's&#160; use, and especially within the field of participatory
      design, a number of techniques&#160; have emerged to more widely explore
      the user's life than had been customary in&#160; traditional,
      function-centered design"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the design development process, generative methods such as
      collaging&#160;<br />
      can be used together with other methods in a converging perspectives
      approach&#160;<br />
      (Sanders, 2000) that draws simultaneously from three perspectives:
      marketing&#160;<br />
      research (“what people say”), applied anthropology (“what people do”)
      and&#160;<br />
      participatory design (“what people make”). When all three perspectives
      are&#160;<br />
      explored simultaneously, we can understand the experience domains of the
      people&#160;<br />
      we are serving through design. When we bring these people through
      guided&#160;<br />
      discovery and give them the generative make tools, we have set the stage
      for them&#160;<br />
      to express their own creative ideas. "
