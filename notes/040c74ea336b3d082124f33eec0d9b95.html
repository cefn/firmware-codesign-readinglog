        <p>"Designers need insight in the diverse contexts surrounding a product's use, and especially within the field of participatory design, a number of techniques have emerged to more widely explore the user's life than had been customary in traditional, function-centered design"</p>
        <p>"In the design development process, generative methods such as collaging<br/>can be used together with other methods in a converging perspectives approach<br/>(Sanders, 2000) that draws simultaneously from three perspectives: marketing<br/>research (“what people say”), applied anthropology (“what people do”) and<br/>participatory design (“what people make”). When all three perspectives are<br/>explored simultaneously, we can understand the experience domains of the people<br/>we are serving through design. When we bring these people through guided<br/>discovery and give them the generative make tools, we have set the stage for them<br/>to express their own creative ideas. "</p>
