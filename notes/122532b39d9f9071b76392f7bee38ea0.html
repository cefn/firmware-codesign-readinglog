        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>This paper talks about 'communities of practice' as a social structure, which act as a foundation for 'learning' and are built around forms of 'competence' recognised internally to the community, ways of participating, artefacts, perspectives and forms of knowledge. Identity (updated term to replace Wenger's 'belonging'), trajectory and multimembership are presented as features of the CoP landscape from an individual's point of view. It originates as an analytical tool, to contrast the actual dynamics of social structures to the superficial networks and hierarchies and wishlists of management or authority, but it has since become 'instrumental' as a means of engineering social structures.</p>
        <p>Does CDPF need to be aware of the potential for dis-identification with programming as an obstacle to participant engagement. What can be done to overcome this?</p>
        <p>The following extract seems relevant to @ShrimpingIt as well...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Managing one’s membership in existing communities: how do I contribute to communities I belong to or could belong to?</li>
            <li>Seeing a boundary to be bridged and becoming brokers using multimembership as a bridge across practices</li>
            <li>Being in a unique position to see the need for a community with the legitimacy to call it into being and becoming conveners</li>
            <li>Connecting someone, like a patient or a student, to a community that will enhance their learning capability</li>
            <li>Providing transversal connections in a context where vertical and horizontal accountability structures are disjointed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Quotations</h2>
        <p>"A community of practice can be viewed as a social learning system. Arising out of learning, it exhibits many characteristics of systems more generally: emergent structure, complex relationships, self-organization, dynamic boundaries, ongoing negotiation of identity and cultural meaning..."</p>
        <p>"we produce physical and conceptual artifacts—words, tools, concepts, methods, stories, documents, links to resources, and other forms of reification—that reflect our shared experience and around which we organize our participation" - good summary of a boundary object, within a community of practice</p>
        <p>"On the one hand, we engage directly in activities, conversations, reflections, and other forms of personal<strong>
                <em>participation</em>
            </strong>in social life. On the other hand, we produce physical and conceptual artifacts—words, tools,<br/>concepts, methods, stories, documents, links to resources, and other forms of<strong>
                <em>reification</em>
            </strong>—that reflect our shared experience and around which we organize our participation." - reification is a solid link to the notion of boundary object?</p>
        <p>"Artifacts without participation do not carry their own meaning; and participation without artifacts is fleeting, unanchored, and uncoordinated."</p>
        <p>" community...participants... define a “regime of competence,” ...by which they recognize membership. This competence includes ...understanding what matters, what the enterprise of the community is, and how it gives<br/>rise to a perspective on the world" - links to the potential to share programmer "gambits" with non-programmers to help them participate in code design.</p>
        <p>"Learning is not just acquiring skills and information; it is becoming a certain person—a knower in a context where what it means to know is negotiated with respect to the regime of competence of a community."</p>
        <p>"Engagement ...can... be a way to explore a boundary if we can have enough access to the practice."</p>
        <p>"The regime of competence of a community of practice translates into a regime of accountability— accountability to what the community is about, to its open issues and challenges, to the quality of relationships in the community, to the accumulated products of its history. When an academic community expects a doctoral student to contribute something new through a dissertation, it first expects that student to do a literature review. This is a way to honor the history of learning of that community. Becoming accountable to history also enables the student to discover the learning edge of the practice, the places where a contribution makes sense and is possible. It is this double accountability to the past and the future of the practice that equips the student to contribute to its evolution as a full participant"</p>
        <p>"my colleague Jean Lave and I coined the term “community of practice” in the late 80’s"</p>
        <p>"Gillian Evans (2006) has observed some kids dis-identifying with school-based accountability because of their accountability to other communities they belong to on the street"</p>
        <p>" How can the practice become the curriculum? How can it be made visible and inspectable? What should participants do together to learn and benefit from the partnership?"<strong>
                <em>does this question relate to what needs to be disclosed about programming to non-programmers?</em>

        <h2>Boundary Objects</h2>
        <h2>Concepts</h2>
        <p>Boundaries of practice - a corrolary to communities of practice, indicating a separation between those who are 'involved' in a negotiated meaning, and those who aren't. An additional, linked concept 'active boundaries'.</p>
        <p>Dis-identification - rejection of the power plays and regime of accountability associated with a specific community.</p>
