    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"The methodologies of Participatory<br>
      Design (PD) and Joint Application<br>
      D e s i g n ( JAD ) have established<br>
      themselves in Scandinavia and North<br>
      America as. influential thrusts in<br>
      software development, yet there is<br>
      virtually no cross-fertilization. PD and<br>
      J A D are simultaneously similar,<br>
      complementary, and contradictory."</p>
    <p>"IS organizations realized that a methodology with a high degree of user
      involvement would lead to better systems,"</p>
    <p>"We begin with two areas in the J A D approach that can benefit from PD<br>
      principles (participant selection and<br>
      creativity), then discuss one area in<br>
      which the PD approach can benefit<br>
      from JAD (structure)."</p>
    <p>"AD practitioners utilize<br>
      many creative techniques and para-<br>
      phernalia in the design process, from<br>
      magnetic displays that can be moved<br>
      around a whiteboard, to prototypes<br>
      of various kinds. However, all t o o<br>
      often, these are minimal, and in<br>
      practice there are many JAD practi-<br>
      tioners that utilize the old methods of<br>
      long documentation, tedious text,<br>
      and excessive reliance on flow-charting techniques.</p>
