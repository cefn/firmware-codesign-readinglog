        Design in a Human-Computer Interaction Course: Teaching Ethnography
        Methods to Computer Scientists</a></h1>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;They have explored using paper prototyping and ethnography within a
      HCI course, teaching computer scientists. I like their distinction between
      a Software Designer and a Software Engineer. Resonates very strongly with
      my own view.</p>
    <p>Paper provides a nice overview of the intent and differences between
      techniques such as User-Centred Design, Human-Centered Systems,
      Participatory Design and Contextual Design. Particularly good summary of
      Ethnography.</p>

    <p>Contextual Design, Ethnography</p>

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"Software designers need to apply methods that provide insights into the
      user's mental model of the application's target task and to invite the
      user to be an active participant in the design process."</p>
    <p>"While the software programmer/engineer is concerned with developing
      reliable, robust, and maintainable software, the software designer is
      concerned with creating products that fit within the user's overall
      activities, enhance productivity, and produce a satisfying experience"</p>
    <p>"Left to their own devices, computer programmers take a "systems-centered
      point of view", concerned about "how the software works and what parts of
      it do what" [8, p. 217-218]."</p>
    <p>"Contextual design relies on ethnographic techniques from anthropology
      [10, 19, 15, 4, 5]. Ethnography is a method of research in which the
      researcher gathers data within a natural setting that involves a dynamic
      network o f interrelated variables. No attempt is made to control
      variables within the setting, for this could alter or destroy the
      phenomenon being studied. The purpose o f ethnographic research is to
      attempt to understand what is happening naturally in the setting, and
      through interpreting the data gathered to see what implications can be
      formed from the data."</p>
    <p>"The final product produced from an ethnographic study should be a 'thick
      description" of the situation, so that the situation appears sufficiently
      realistic, and so that others in examining the description can determine
      whether the implications drawn from the study can be applied to other
      settings."</p>
    <p>"HCI Students [after being taught Participatory Design] lamented that
      while they now understood the way design should be done, based on their
      experiences "unfortunately that is not the way it is done in the real
      world.""</p>
