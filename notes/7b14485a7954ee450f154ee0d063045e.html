    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"we are proposing a cooperative prototyping approach where users are
      involved actively and creatively in design and evaluation of early
      prototypes. This paper illustrates the approach by describing the design
      of computer support for casework in a technical department of a Danish
      municipality"</p>
    <p>"during preparation of sessions it is necessary to think of a<br>
      repertoire of good example applications to have in stock for the next
      sessions. This<br>
      corresponds to an attempt to anticipate the potential direction of
      development of<br>
      the group in the following sessions"</p>
    <p>"There are other ways of being prepared for such situations. We see less
      fancy prototyping means such as mock-ups, see for example Kyng (1989);
      Bodker (1991) as a handy support. What we are thinking of is using
      anything from simple paper screen images to more advanced slide- or
      video-based simulations to support design. Vertelney (1989) describes the
      use of a range of tools from simple drawings in flip-books to advanced
      video-based animations for storyboard prototyping. Earlier projects
      (Btidker er al., 1987) have shown that often mock-up simulations are more
      easily set up for illustration than are computer-based prototypes. A
      disadvantage of mock-ups, however, is that it is harder for users to
      experience dynamic aspects of the future system than it is with a
      computer-based prototype simulation"</p>
