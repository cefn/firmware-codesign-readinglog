        <p>"we are proposing a cooperative prototyping approach where users are involved actively and creatively in design and evaluation of early prototypes. This paper illustrates the approach by describing the design of computer support for casework in a technical department of a Danish municipality"</p>
        <p>"during preparation of sessions it is necessary to think of a<br/>repertoire of good example applications to have in stock for the next sessions. This<br/>corresponds to an attempt to anticipate the potential direction of development of<br/>the group in the following sessions"</p>
        <p>"There are other ways of being prepared for such situations. We see less fancy prototyping means such as mock-ups, see for example Kyng (1989); Bodker (1991) as a handy support. What we are thinking of is using anything from simple paper screen images to more advanced slide- or video-based simulations to support design. Vertelney (1989) describes the use of a range of tools from simple drawings in flip-books to advanced video-based animations for storyboard prototyping. Earlier projects (Btidker er al., 1987) have shown that often mock-up simulations are more easily set up for illustration than are computer-based prototypes. A disadvantage of mock-ups, however, is that it is harder for users to experience dynamic aspects of the future system than it is with a computer-based prototype simulation"</p>
