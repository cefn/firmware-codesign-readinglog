    <p>"Aesthetic experiences are those that are immersive, infused with

    <p>"Recent years have seen a surge of interest in reclaiming the idea that
      instructional design (ID) is indeed a design discipline and more than just
      science or just technology...In the spirit of this view of ID as design,
      this article offers principles intended to contribute to developing the
      aesthetics of instructional design (Parrish 2005). By broadening their
      concerns beyond immediate learning outcomes and considering all the
      qualities of designed experiences, instructional designers can create
      designs that have deep and lasting impacts for learners."</p>
