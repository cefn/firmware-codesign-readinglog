      Interesting take from IS with strong statements about methodology which
      should be considered for the PhD. Plenty to read here.

      "This book on Design Research in Information Systems by Hevner and
      Chatterjee is an important effort to build bridges across the technology
      perspective and the managerial and behavioral perspectives of information
      systems."

      "the thesis we are explaining is a type of research method we call design
      science research."

        <p>
      "Design science research is a research paradigm in which a designer
      answers questions relevant to human problems via the creation of
      innovative artifacts, thereby contributing new knowledge to the body of
      scientific evidence. The designed artifacts are both useful and
      fundamental in understanding that problem."
