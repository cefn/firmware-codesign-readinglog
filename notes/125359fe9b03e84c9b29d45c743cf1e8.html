        <p>"large-scale engineering projects require system integrators<br/>that can manage not only the technical interfaces but also<br/>the organizational ones. This paper proposes a boundary<br/>object framework that can assist in understanding the<br/>role of these systems integrators by observing changes<br/>in organizational interfaces. This framework does so by<br/>monitoring the objects and artifacts used at the interfaces."</p>
