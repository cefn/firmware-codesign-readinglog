    <p>"large-scale engineering projects require system integrators<br>
      that can manage not only the technical interfaces but also<br>
      the organizational ones. This paper proposes a boundary<br>
      object framework that can assist in understanding the<br>
      role of these systems integrators by observing changes<br>
      in organizational interfaces. This framework does so by<br>
      monitoring the objects and artifacts used at the interfaces."</p>
