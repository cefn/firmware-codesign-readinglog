        <p>"This book is divided into three parts, dealing with procedural abstractions, data<br/>abstractions, and abstractions of state.</p>
        <p>"A procedure is a way of abstracting what’s called a computational process. Roughly speaking, a process is a dynamic succession of events—a happening."</p>
        <p>"Data is the information processed by computational processes, not only the externally visible information, but also the internal information structures used within the processes."</p>
        <p>"State is anything that can be changed by one part of a computation in order to have an effect on a later part of the computation."</p>
