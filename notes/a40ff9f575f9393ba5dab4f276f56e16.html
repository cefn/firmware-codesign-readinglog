    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Referred to by Bratteteig. Offers a set of abstractions for computation,
      which are presented as educational, but also perhaps exhaustive of the
      space of possible computations. </p>

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"This book is divided into three parts, dealing with procedural
      abstractions, data<br>
      abstractions, and abstractions of state. </p>
    <p>"A procedure is a way of abstracting what’s called a computational
      process. Roughly speaking, a process is a dynamic succession of events—a
      happening."</p>
    <p>"Data is the information processed by computational processes, not only
      the externally visible information, but also the internal information
      structures used within the processes."</p>
    <p>"State is anything that can be changed by one part of a computation in
      order to have an effect on a later part of the computation."</p>
