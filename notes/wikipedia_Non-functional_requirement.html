    <p>"Broadly, functional requirements define what a system is supposed to <i>do</i>
      whereas non-functional requirements define how a system is supposed to <i>be</i>.
      Functional requirements are usually in the form of "system shall do
      &lt;requirement&gt;", while non-functional requirements are "system shall
      be &lt;requirement&gt;".</p>
    <p>Non-functional requirements are often called <b>qualities</b> of a
      system. Other terms for non-functional requirements are "constraints",
      "quality attributes", "quality goals", "quality of service requirements"
      and "non-behavioral requirements".<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a

      Informally these are sometimes called the "ilities", from attributes like
      stability and portability. Qualities, that is non-functional requirements,
      can be divided into two main categories:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Execution qualities, such as security and usability, which are
        observable at run time.</li>
      <li>Evolution qualities, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testability"
          title="Software testability">testability</a>, maintainability,
        extensibility and scalability, which are embodied in the static
        structure of the software system.<sup id="cite_ref-Wiegers03_2-0" class="reference"><a
