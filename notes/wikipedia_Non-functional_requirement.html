        <p>"Broadly, functional requirements define what a system is supposed to<i>do</i>whereas non-functional requirements define how a system is supposed to<i>be</i>. Functional requirements are usually in the form of "system shall do &lt;requirement&gt;", while non-functional requirements are "system shall be &lt;requirement&gt;".</p>
        <p>Non-functional requirements are often called<b>qualities</b>of a system. Other terms for non-functional requirements are "constraints", "quality attributes", "quality goals", "quality of service requirements" and "non-behavioral requirements".<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference">

            </sup>Informally these are sometimes called the "ilities", from attributes like stability and portability. Qualities, that is non-functional requirements, can be divided into two main categories:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Execution qualities, such as security and usability, which are observable at run time.</li>
            <li>Evolution qualities, such as<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testability" title="Software testability">testability</a>, maintainability, extensibility and scalability, which are embodied in the static structure of the software system.<sup id="cite_ref-Wiegers03_2-0" class="reference">
