        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>An important reference, underpinned in relevance by the fact that Alan is here at Lancaster University. Heavily model-oriented? PhD should be positioned relative to this work.</p>

        <p>"I have a disinclination to build models of the user and distrust of excessively task-oriented analyses. Instead, the models are formal models of the system from the user’s viewpoint. The principles primarily address issues of observability and control. That is, they emphasise the user as being in<br/>charge of the interaction, and don’t presume to determine precisely what the user will do."</p>
        <p>"Thimbleby (1984) introduced the concept of generative user engineering<br/>principles (GUEPS). These are principles having several properties:<br/>• They apply to a large class of different systems: that is, they are generic.<br/>• They can be given both an informal colloquial statement and also a formal<br/>statement.<br/>• They can be used to constrain the design of a given system: that is, they<br/>generate the design."</p>
