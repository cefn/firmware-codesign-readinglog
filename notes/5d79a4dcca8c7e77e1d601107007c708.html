    <p>"I have a disinclination to build models of the user and distrust of
      excessively task-oriented analyses. Instead, the models are formal models
      of the system from the user’s viewpoint. The principles primarily address
      issues of observability and control. That is, they emphasise the user as
      being in<br>
      charge of the interaction, and don’t presume to determine precisely what
      the user will do."</p>
    <p>"Thimbleby (1984) introduced the concept of generative user engineering<br>
      principles (GUEPS). These are principles having several properties:<br>
      • They apply to a large class of different systems: that is, they are
      generic.<br>
      • They can be given both an informal colloquial statement and also a
      formal<br>
      statement.<br>
      • They can be used to constrain the design of a given system: that is,
      they<br>
      generate the design."</p>
