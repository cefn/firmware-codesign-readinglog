        <h2>Relevance</h2>
        <p>Not very relevant. Although it touches on and references thinkers who cover people's relationships to products (emotional, valuation), the interaction design and firmware oriented aspects are non-existent. Most objects in the 'inventories' described are non-digital.</p>
        <h2>Quotations</h2>
        <p>"we went to participants’ homes and asked a<br/>number of questions about their likes, loves, and dislikes with<br/>respect to things they own, especially things constructed with<br/>the materials of digital technologies (IRB #07-12036). A<br/>sample of the questions we asked (where appropriate)<br/>includes: What things do you have that you love? What things<br/>do you have that you thought you would love but don’t? What<br/>things do you have that you didn’t expect to love but do?<br/>What things do you have more than one of? What are the<br/>oldest things you have? That you still use? That you no<br/>longer use but would not discard? What are the newest<br/>things you have? What do you acquire most frequently?"</p>
        <p>"Our study produced rich data consisting of handwritten field<br/>notes, sketches, audio recordings, and several hundreds of<br/>photographs. We also listened to recordings and transcribed<br/>relevant segments. We then organized these relevant portions<br/>into themes and coded the collective textual and visual<br/>documents using these emergent themes."</p>
