        <p>"Design and design research do not primarily focus on explaining the world as it is;<br/>they share with engineering a fundamental interest in focusing on the world as it could be. Design fiction is a new approach, which<br/>integrates these two perspectives, in order to develop a method toolbox for design research for a complex world"</p>
        <p>"Design and design research do not primarily focus<br/>on the world as it is, like most scientific disciplines, trying to develop descriptions,<br/>interpretations, and explanations of existing objects, processes, and activities; design and<br/>design research share with engineering a fundamental interest in focusing on the world as it<br/>could be, on the imagination and realization of possible futures, as well as on the disclosure<br/>of new worlds."</p>
