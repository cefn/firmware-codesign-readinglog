    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Suggests to me a position and interpretation that...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Undertaking and succeeding at something which <em>ought</em> to be
        done is something which should be publishable, (a moral/critical
        motivation - in contrast to prototyping or quantitative work perhaps
        being the only accepted valid in CS).</li>
      <li>Industry itself needs this moral work - it's not ivory tower stuff,
        because the moral perspective invests human value in a way which sterile
        methodologies do not, this translates into delivery relevance.</li>

    <h2>Field of Study</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"our pragmatic framework ...[is] used to identify key questions IS
      researchers should ask in engaging the different ends of research
      inquiry... [W]e illustrate the value of our framework by considering and
      questioning the explicit and implicit ends of experimental
      research—research often considered beyond deliberate questions about
      ethics, value judgments, and power relations. We...propos[e] some
      practical recommendations IS researchers could employ in questioning and
      selecting IS topics, designing and executing their studies, and
      representing their research in publications."</p>
    <p>"These three normative sciences are interdependent in that answers to
      logic (i.e., approaches to reasoning) presuppose conclusions about ethics
      (i.e., methods of conduct), and answers to ethics presuppose conclusions
      about aesthetics (i.e., the anticipated and desirable outcomes) (Stuhr
      1994)."</p>
    <p>"the entire effort rests on choices about the ethical conduct of
      researchers, and a deliberation about the anticipated and desirable
      outcomes worth pursuing in IS research...In other words, our choice of
      logic presupposes questions and answers about ethics and aesthetics."</p>
    <p>"Recent commentaries have argued that research needs to move toward
      phronesis by taking into account situational and value-rational<br>
      questions in specific organizational and practical settings, such as
      “where are we going? Is this development desirable? What, if anything,
      should we do about it?” (Flyvbjerg 2006, p. 375). These questions seek to
      balance instrumental (i.e., efficiency, getting things done) with value
      rationality (i.e., which of our local and situated values become affected
      and how),"</p>
    <p>"A sympathetic view [of experimental IS research] would argue that by
      representing work in<br>
      this way, the results of our work can be added up and<br>
      meticulously compared and contrasted to rule any future<br>
      uncertainty about the development and implementation of<br>
      information systems."</p>
    <p>"A critical view would argue that the long-term impact of IS research is
      more likely to emerge through the generation of alternative and even
      conflicting visions of IS activity, and that the adding up of
      generalizable knowledge is both impossible and undesirable in its
      conservative form."</p>
    <p>"We understand that many researchers may believe that their work is
      completed once the results are produced and pub-<br>
      lished in journal articles. What happens beyond this methodological and
      theoretical project is felt to be neither their particular responsibility
      nor under their control. In turn, they may consider choices about ethics,
      aesthetics, and the highest good—including the relations of power in
      shaping these choices—to be more important to industrial participants than
      academics." [can I weigh in to this debate - claim ground?]</p>
    <p>"research involves not just choices about instrumental rationality (i.e.,
      how to conduct a study), but also about value rationality (i.e., what do
      we study and who is affected by our work)"</p>
    <p>"It is these other higher ends—ethics, aesthetics, and the highest
      good—which define what a community of inquiry is about and achieves, and
      thus they require more explicit attention."</p>
