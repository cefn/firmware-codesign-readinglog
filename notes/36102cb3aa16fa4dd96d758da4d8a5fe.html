    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;Their tripartite analysis of the requirements process is useful
      perhaps, to differentiate scope or stages in workshop processes. </p>
    <p>Their observation that RE researchers focus on the what rather than the
      how, may reveal one of the core issues here. Whilst specifying 'what' can
      appear to be a complete description, once you embark on the 'how' (having
      to implement the 'what'), other unspecified aspects emerge, which in
      practice project back onto the 'what' - e.g. interactions required in the
      device which are too complex to be feasible in the field, incorrect defaults
      which take no account of users' needs. This may link to the notion of
      'non-functional' requirements (see wikipedia).</p>

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"design requirements rather than software requirements as an inclusive
      term better characterizes all requirements issues within these ecosystems
      that need to be addressed at the crossroads of business development,
      software engineering, and industrial design"</p>
    <p>"[Requirements Engineering] is replete with analytical frameworks,
      standards for requirements quality, elicitation protocols, and modeling
      methodologies"</p>
    <p>"we adopt a widely employed and straightforward categorization of the
      requirements processes into three facets: (1) discovery, (2)
      specification,<br>
      and (3) validation and verification&nbsp; During discovery, designers
      develop an understanding of the application domain and infer specific
      design needs through consultation with stakeholders and other sources
      [18]. Requirements specification is both a noun and a verb in RE parlance.
      As a noun, a specification is the document in which the requirements for a
      design effort are articulated thus representing an agreement between the
      stakeholders<br>
      and the design team [16,24]. The verb suggests the process of developing
      and managing the specification document; it is the process by which the
      design team acquires, abstracts, and represents the requirements [17,22].
      Finally, during requirements validation and verification designers ensure
      that the requirements are (1) of high quality, (2) by addressing the
      users’ needs, (3) and being appropriate for the design effort, and (4)
      having no<br>
      inconsistencies or defects"</p>
    <p>"Requirements researchers have also stated that requirements are properly
      concerned with what is to be achieved by a design artifact,<br>
      without regard to how it will be designed and implemented"</p>
