    <h2>Authors</h2>
    <p>Daniela Sangiorgi, Brendon Clark</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Referenced as providing a model of service design, incorporating the
      participatory design of 'rules'. Also heavily engaged in design
      workshopping.</p>
    <h2>Field of Study</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>action research, service design, workshop design</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"Some of the most elusive aspects of designing an intangible service that
      is co-produced by users and suppliers during a service encounter are to
      identify the object of design and finding a way to explain that to
      others."</p>
    <p>"Services are complex social systems made up of situated activities where
      people behave and interact following and negotiating predefined roles and
      rules and using available tools and information."</p>
    <p>"A guiding hypothesis throughout our project is that the success of
      designing good services can be increased by alleviating potential
      conflicts during the service encounter through synchronizing the
      perspectives, goals and existing practices and capacities of service
      participants. To address this, the perspectives and practices of the
      service participants should therefore be included in the design process."</p>
    <p>"It is our contention that models and tools can help service designers
      understand and handle this kind of complexity, and help them facilitate
      the involvement of other stakeholders throughout the design process."</p>
    <p>"The workshop provided us with the opportunity to introduce contextual
      representations of service participants into the design activities
      conducted with representatives of our industrial partners to actively
      enVISion potential design encounters. Inspired by the "design by doing"
      participatory approach we acted as the workshop facilitators proposing
      design materials and "hands-on experiences" to collaboratively design
      service ideas with the workshop participants."</p>
    <p>"Activity System Map discussion. We had prepared four poster-sized maps
      that synthetically represented the Activity System of each of the four
      main organizational contexts we visited. (2 supermarkets, 1 technical
      service contractor, 1 education center). During this session, we briefly
      introduced the Activity System concept and then used the posters as
      mediating tools exchange information and stimulate conversation."</p>
    <p>"The cards represented, through a brief text and a representative image,
      existing problematic situations and conflicting perspectives of the
      service context and participants."</p>
    <p>"We initially had hoped that the introduction and application of Activity
      Theory model, describing and explaining the main elements that
      characterize a service action, would support this change."</p>
    <p>"using ethnography and Activity Theory provided encouraging results, more
      must be done on the compromise between two opposing demands: the necessity
      to understand and represent the richness and complexity of a service
      context, while creating a design and communication language able to handle
      it."</p>
    <p>"In the action-research project described here, we introduced and further
      developed a service design approach with industrial partners based on the
      assumption that the design of successful services depends upon a holistic
      and participatory approach. During the project, with these ideas in mind,
      we attempted to use and develop tools that both helped us and others
      appreciate the richness and complexity of a service context and to
      incorporate those understandings during the service design process under
      realistic industrial and research constraints of time and resources."</p>
