      &#160;Written by Rachel Cooper (who studied with me at Nottingham). She
      proposes (through sceptical attacks on other candidate approaches) that
      cross the gap of understanding to an alien form of life (for example
      sociologists trying to understand natural scientists) that the
      anthropological embedding technique is the single way she can identify
      for a researcher to have a meaningful encounter with another form of
      life, and that an empathetic account of anthropological embedding is the
      only thing which can help someone who can't directly have the encounter
      (the reader is expected to empathise with the anthropological character
      in the anthro-novel, so they can arrive at that path-dependent knowledge
      through elements they have in common) .

      "I have argued that there is a method that might enable sociologists of
      scientific knowledge to gain understanding of an alien form of life and
      to pass on this understanding to their readers. The sociologists would
      first have to gain understanding of the form of life themselves through
      enculturation. ...If the sociologists of science succeed in becoming
      enculturated then their next challenge is to create an anthro-novel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The bad news is that so far as I know no Sociologist of Scientific
      Knowledge has written an anthro-novel to date. As such those existing
      case studies that claim to enable readers to understand scientists
      belonging to different forms of life cannot be doing this. The techniques
      that their authors use to try and enable the aliens to be understood are
      simply not up to the job.&#160;"
