        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>Found when searching for combined mentions of co-design and Dewey as a pragmatist, but also the name Steen has come up a few times?</p>
        <p>Includes a progressive and relational statement of "user-centred design" morphing through "human-centred design" into "participatory design", the "lead user" approach and finally "co-design".</p>
        <p>Reading in full, and especially the commentated extracts of Dewey's "How we think" and "Logic: The theory of inquiry" would be valuable.</p>

        <p>"industrial design practice is changing in two significant ways. It is moving towards organizing processes in which designers cooperate with other experts and with (potential) users and stakeholders and engage in processes of co-design, rather than doing the design work alone and in isolation. It is also moving towards facilitating change processes rather creating finished products; designers engage in joint processes of organizational change, in which new products or services or processes are developed. The focus of industrial design shifts from designing a finished-product to engaging in co-design-as-a-process and facilitating diverse people to jointly work in an innovation process."</p>
        <p>"both practising designers and design theorists need new foundations to understand and organize such co-design-as-a-process because the foundations from science and from engineering have become inappropriate"</p>
        <p>"Pragmatist John Dewey explains that the process of reflective thinking (1910, pp. 68-78), or the process of inquiry (1938, pp. 101-119), consists of five closely related processes, which run partly in sequence, partly in parallel: 1) Perceiving a situation as ‘questionable’; 2) Exploring and formulating the problem provisionally; 3) Simultaneously exploring and further developing the problem (‘perceptual’) and possible solutions (‘conceptual’); 4) Exploring the relations between problems (ends) and solutions (means); and 5) Trying-out solutions in practice to find out whether or how they can help to solve the problem."</p>
        <p>"The focus on user experience (or customer experience) is related to the shift towards service design. In service design (Cottam and Leadbeater 2004; Parker and Heapy 2006) one is concerned with service encounters, with how a person experiences the various encounters with a specific service, e.g., a banking service or a health care service."</p>
        <p>"In order to change service encounters and service touch points, one may need to change processes within the organization or how the organization works."</p>
        <p>"the distinction between the shift in the process of design, via user-centred design and human-centred design towards co-design, and the shift in content of design, via interaction design and service design towards transformation design, are too schematic. Both in theory and in practice, one cannot, and does not need to, separate between design process and design content in such crude terms."</p>
        <p>"A group of motivated and skilled people—an experienced project manager, capable project team members and committed stakeholders—would typically be able to conduct co-design-as-a-process successfully via all sorts of improvisation and the application of intuition, people skills and tacit knowledge. Although I do not believe there is anything wrong about such an approach, I also believe that an improved understanding of co-design can help to explore better ways to organize co-design"</p>
        <p>"The point that I wish to make, is that co-design-as-a-process seems to be based on foundations from science and from engineering and that these foundations are insufficient for realizing the potential of co-design-as-a-process, for facilitating communication and cooperation that are so crucial. My speculation is that both design theorists and practitioners could benefit from exploring new foundations."</p>
        <p>"Pragmatism focuses on practices, on what people’s experiences, on what they think and feel, on processes of communication and cooperation between people, and on the future"</p>
