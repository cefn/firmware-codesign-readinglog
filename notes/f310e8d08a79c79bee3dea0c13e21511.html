        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>The source of a really nice diagram (Figure 2.) which I recall from earlier study (before this readinglog), differentiating all the different roles and specialisms and positioning interaction designers (stereotype:real world experimenters?) relative to HCI practitioners (stereotype:academics?).</p>

        <h2>Relevance</h2>
        <p>Provides a methodological foundation for using design as a research method.</p>
        <h2>Quotations</h2>
        <p>"While design has gained a strong foothold in practice, it has had much less impact on<br/>the HCI research community"</p>
        <p>"Following a research through design approach, designers<br/>produce novel integrations of HCI research in an attempt to<br/>make the right thing: a product that transforms the world<br/>from its current state to a preferred state. This model allows<br/>interaction designers to make research contributions based<br/>on their strength in addressing under-constrained problems."</p>
        <p>"Over the last two years we have<br/>undertaken a research project to (i) understand the nature of<br/>the relationship between interaction design and the HCI<br/>research community, and (ii) to discover and invent<br/>methods for interaction design researchers to more effectively participate in HCI research."</p>
        <p>"This lack<br/>of a vision for interaction design research represents a lost<br/>opportunity for the HCI research community to benefit<br/>from the added perspective of design thinking in a<br/>collaborative research environment."</p>
        <p>"Design thinking. This term is often used to describe what<br/>designers bring to problem solving and to rationalize why<br/>designers need to be included in a project or process;<br/>however, it is rarely defined. In some respects its ambiguity<br/>is part of its strength, allowing it to be the right thing at the<br/>right time. In terms of this paper, we mean the application<br/>of a design process that involves grounding—investigation<br/>to gain multiple perspectives on a problem; ideation—<br/>generation of many possible different solutions; iteration—<br/>cyclical process of refining concept with increasing fidelity;<br/>and reflection."</p>
        <p>"We formalize the model by describing four<br/>lenses to evaluate the quality of an interaction design<br/>research contribution. Finally, we illustrate how three<br/>examples of interaction design research can be evaluated by<br/>the criteria described here."</p>
        <p>"we held four one-<br/>on-one presentations of the model along with other research<br/>models including Dick Buchanan’s model of design<br/>research [4] and Daniel Fallman’s model of research-<br/>oriented design and design-oriented research [12,13]."</p>
        <p>"Through an active process of ideating, iterating, and<br/>critiquing potential solutions, design researchers continually<br/>reframe the problem as they attempt to make the right<br/>thing. The final output of this activity is a concrete problem<br/>framing and articulation of the preferred state, and a series<br/>of artifacts—models, prototypes, products, and documentation of the design process."</p>
