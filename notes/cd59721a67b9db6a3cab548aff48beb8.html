    <p>
      Strongly relates to boundary object use in workshops - in particular
      Cards as a mechanism for stimulating ideation.

      "We present the Inspiration Card Workshop as a collaborative method for
      combining findings from domain studies, represented in Domain Cards, with
      sources of inspiration from applications of technology, represented in
      Technology Cards, to create new concepts for design. We report our
      findings from three projects in which we have used the method"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cards can successfully frame and guide workshops with disparate
      participants and bring various sources of inspiration into the design
      process. We furthermore compare the method to four related methods in the
      design process, namely Future Workshops, Metaphorical Design, Interaction
      Relabelling and Lateral Thinking."

      "According to Schön [27,28], design is a reflective interaction (or in
      his terminology “conversation”) with materials, wherein the designer
      works with different media or materials, experimenting with various
      aspects of the design. In the case of information systems, a diverse set
      of design materials is being used, including video, paper documents,
      mock-ups, prototypes and posters. Moreover, small paper documents are
      commonly used as an integrated part of various design techniques. One
      category of small paper documents is the Post-it"

      "In this section we briefly introduce four related approaches to<br />
      innovation in design, and use them as a platform for<br />
      comparing them with The Inspiration Card Workshops...The<br />
      essence of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">metaphorical
      design</span> is to understand the product<br />
      being designed by using metaphors to see it as something<br />
      different, and in this way generate new perceptions,<br />
      explanations, and inventions....the <span style=
      "text-decoration: underline;">Future<br />
      workshop</span> technique is meant to shed light on the common,<br />
      problematic situation of generating visions for the future, and<br />
      to discuss how these visions can be realized. Key elements of<br />
      the technique include a set of specific rules such as restricting<br />
      speaking time to 30 seconds during certain periods of the<br />
      workshop, and not allowing critique during the fantasy<br />
      phase...<span style="text-decoration: underline;">'Interaction
      Relabelling</span>' has at its core a consideration of the<br />
      product one is designing in terms of an existing product...The idea of
      ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Extreme Characters</span>’, as
      the term suggests,<br />
      takes the approach of design for characters with extreme emotional
      attitudes... Lateral thinking<br />
      Lateral thinking, introduced by de Bono [11] includes a large<br />
      collection of creativity techniques... <em>random input</em>... has at
      its core<br />
      the selection of a randomly chosen word... which acts as the<br />
      starting point for idea generation."
