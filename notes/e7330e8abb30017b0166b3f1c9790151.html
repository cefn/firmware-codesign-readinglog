      "Stakeholders may forget or not be aware of requirements, and analysts,
      without the deep domain knowledge of most stakeholders, may not be able
      to fill in the gaps. In addition, som requirements and constraints my be
      so obvious to an expert stakeholder that they do not seem worth
      mentioning, but the thin spread of domain expertise among analyst teams
      means that these unstated requirements may no the recognized or
      incorporated into the development process."
