    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"we focus on how different design situations evolve as an interplay among
      participants, things, surroundings, and social constructs...it draws our
      attention to how participants in a design event frame and reframe their
      understanding, and resolve problematic situations through the use of
      design materials."</p>
    <p>"Material design artefacts are employed in a wide range of collaborative
      design events, for instance mock-ups [8] probes [15], props [2] and
      card-based design games, such as Inspiration Card Workshops [4]."</p>
