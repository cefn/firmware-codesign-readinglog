      Difference between 'industrial' and 'convivial' design tools (credited to

      "The need to be directly involved in the creation and production of goods
      and services is<br/>
      pointing toward a human-centered design revolution, with the act of
      co-creation between<br/>
      designers and everyday people being the end goal."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Design for Adapting has been referred to as “underdesign” (Moran, 2002),
      meta-<br/>
      design (Fischer, 2003), and as “loose fit” design (Rapoport, 1990). The
      idea is that people can<br/>
      and will fill in the designed artifact to meet their own needs and
      dreams. In fact, the less you<br/>
      give them, the more they fill in (McCloud, 1999)."
