      Suggested as the seminal work in service blueprinting, which builds on a
      critique of services from a user point of view.

      "The development of a new service is usually characterized by trial and
      error. Developers translate a subjective description of a need into an
      operational concept that may bear only a remote resemblance to the
      original idea. No one systematically quantifies the process or devises
      tests to ensure that the service is complete, rational, and fulfills the
      original need objectively."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are several reasons for the lack of analytical service systems
      designs. Services are unusual in that they have impact, but no form. Like
      light, they canâ€™t be physically stored or possessed and their consumption
      is often simultaneous with their production."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is important to watch out for parts of the service that the consumer
      does not see, like purchasing of supplies. Though invisible, these
      processes are important because changing them may alter the way consumers
      perceive the service."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isolating fail points. Having diagrammed the processes involved, the
      designer can now see where the system might go awry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A blueprint facilitates the analysis of cost-benefit trade-offs and can
      be used to test the appeal of different designs to prospective
      customers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very little of this service is visible to customers. In fact, customers
      have virtually no conception of the processes that underlie most
      services."
