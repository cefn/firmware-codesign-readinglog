        <p>"The development of a new service is usually characterized by trial and error. Developers translate a subjective description of a need into an operational concept that may bear only a remote resemblance to the original idea. No one systematically quantifies the process or devises tests to ensure that the service is complete, rational, and fulfills the original need objectively."</p>
        <p>"There are several reasons for the lack of analytical service systems designs. Services are unusual in that they have impact, but no form. Like light, they canâ€™t be physically stored or possessed and their consumption is often simultaneous with their production."</p>
        <p>"It is important to watch out for parts of the service that the consumer does not see, like purchasing of supplies. Though invisible, these processes are important because changing them may alter the way consumers perceive the service."</p>
        <p>"Isolating fail points. Having diagrammed the processes involved, the designer can now see where the system might go awry."</p>
        <p>"A blueprint facilitates the analysis of cost-benefit trade-offs and can be used to test the appeal of different designs to prospective customers."</p>
        <p>"Very little of this service is visible to customers. In fact, customers have virtually no conception of the processes that underlie most services."</p>
