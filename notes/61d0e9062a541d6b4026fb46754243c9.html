        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>A PhD Dissertation by Published papers. It's incredibly resonant as indicated by the quotations below. I appreciate his distinction between users and prototypers (orthogonal to technical skill - about the relationship to the artifact).</p>

        <h2>Quotations</h2>
        <p>"On the one hand, prototypes can be powerful boundary objects and an effective way to share ideas, collaborate and communicate across functional boundaries within an organization, but on the other hand the (lack of) ownership of prototypes also plays an important role in the politics and power-relations within an organization."</p>
        <p>"The developers of the interactive prototype, e.g. interaction designers, are in a position to design it in a way that enables<br/>and encourages different stakeholders to take ownership over it."</p>
        <p>"I demonstrate that involving non-designers in the making and shaping of the prototype enables them to take active part in the reflective learning process of prototyping, and develop a sense of ownership over the prototype...Since participants learn about the design space and limitations of the prototype, they are able to give specific feedback and input, which the interaction designer can implement."</p>
        <p>"Designing a flexible prototype in combination with supportive tools to be used by both interaction designers and non-designers during development is introduced as a way to open up the prototyping process to these users."</p>
        <p>"the prototype itself is an object of design, with its users and use context, which deserves further attention."</p>
        <p>"Prototypes ...become the “essential medium for information, interaction, integration, and collaboration” (Schrage 1996).</p>
        <p>"I describe the role of interaction design prototypes in new product development and relate this to discussions in the literature on prototype fidelity, ownership and users"</p>
        <p>"Prototypes occupy the space between fluid concepts and rigid products, and play an important role in the transition from the one to the other."</p>
        <p>"Prototypes can be powerful boundary objects (Carlile 2002), enabling team members to share ideas, communicate and discuss, but this requires bringing in these people at the right time (Schrage 1996)."</p>
        <p>"Showing the prototype later in the process is risky too, since it is often costly to make changes, and developers run the risk of defending design suggestion they invested in, rather than being open to suggestions (cf. Rettig 1994)."</p>
        <p>"It is in the making of prototypes that the prototyper runs into design constraints, makes design decisions, evaluates its implications and thus gets to know the prototype intimately. During this process, interaction designers engage in “thinking through prototyping” (Klemmer et al. 2006), which is a reflective learning process (cf. Schön 1983; Hartmann et al. 2006). This learning is largely tacit; it is not easily transferred by demonstrating the prototype to others, and without this knowledge it can be hard to make useful suggestions, i.e. suggestions that are on the right level of detail and can be implemented. However, involving others in the making of a prototype is not as straightforward as it may seem. Prototyping is an expert activity, requiring some technical knowledge, and can take a long time."</p>
        <p>"Different approaches and methods to develop prototypes have been described and one of the central discussions in the literature has been on what level of detail or fidelity an interaction design prototype is most appropriate in relation to the stage of the project and the type of feedback the designers seek to get with the prototype."</p>
        <p>"When introducing paper prototyping, Rettig (1994) describes five problems with high-fidelity prototypes in the context of software development. They “take too long to build and change” making them ill-suited for early development, “Reviewers and testers tend to comment on “fit and finish” issues” which is a type of feedback that is less relevant in early development, “Developers resist changes” since they invest a lot in the prototype and grow affectionate of it, “A prototype in software can set expectations that will be hard to change” meaning that once others, e.g. a client or user, see the prototype, they will expect it to continue along that path and “A single bug in a hi-fi prototype can bring a test to a complete halt”.</p>
        <p>"Combining the advantages of both [computer-based and paper-based] approaches, without the disadvantages is the ‘holy grail’ I have been seeking throughout my experiences as an interaction designer, both in education, industry and research."</p>
        <p>"Klemmer et al. pose that “[prototypes] themselves embody design ideas or specifications, render them concrete and, in doing so, inform the designer’s thinking”"</p>
