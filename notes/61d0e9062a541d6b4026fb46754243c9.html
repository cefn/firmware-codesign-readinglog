    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"On the one hand, prototypes can be powerful boundary objects and an
      effective way to share ideas, collaborate and communicate across
      functional boundaries within an organization, but on the other hand the
      (lack of) ownership of prototypes also plays an important role in the
      politics and power-relations within an organization."</p>
    <p>"The developers of the interactive prototype, e.g. interaction designers,
      are in a position to design it in a way that enables<br>
      and encourages different stakeholders to take ownership over it."</p>
    <p>"I demonstrate that involving non-designers in the making and shaping of
      the prototype enables them to take active part in the reflective learning
      process of prototyping, and develop a sense of ownership over the
      prototype...Since participants learn about the design space and
      limitations of the prototype, they are able to give specific feedback and
      input, which the interaction designer can implement."</p>
    <p>"Designing a flexible prototype in combination with supportive tools to
      be used by both interaction designers and non-designers during development
      is introduced as a way to open up the prototyping process to these users."</p>
    <p>"the prototype itself is an object of design, with its users and use
      context, which deserves further attention."</p>
    <p>"Prototypes ...become the “essential medium for information, interaction,
      integration, and collaboration” (Schrage 1996).</p>
    <p>"I describe the role of interaction design prototypes in new product
      development and relate this to discussions in the literature on prototype
      fidelity, ownership and users"</p>
    <p>"Prototypes occupy the space between fluid concepts and rigid products,
      and play an important role in the transition from the one to the other."</p>
