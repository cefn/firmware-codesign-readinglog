        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>A Harvard Business Review paper, characterising a matrix representation to help choosing from potentially competing feature sets within a product development process, to try and settle on a best match against customer requirements.</p>
        <p>The approach is centred on the 'Voice of the customer' but it's not obvious that this translates into any kind of user engagement.</p>
        <p>An interesting aspect of the House of Quality matrix representation (illustrated by Exhibit XI in the paper) is that it can potentially decompose recursively to get more and more detailed (where the hows become whats). It suggests that in a suitable problem domain it could handle very small aspects, right the way up to the strategic direction. This is illustrated</p>
        <p>The statement which describes how it mediates between marketing, engineers, and general managers positions it as a clear boundary object.</p>

        <h2>Quotations</h2>
        <p>"The house of quality begins with the customer, whose requirements are called customer attributes (CAs) – phrases customers use to describe products and product characteristics... ...Along the top of the house of quality, the design team lists those engineering characteristics (ECs) that are likely to affect one or more of the customer attributes, the body of the house,<br/>the “relationship matrix,” indicat[es] how much each engineering characteristic affects each customer<br/>attribute....roof matrix helps engineers specify the various engineering features that have to be improved collaterally...[and] negative relation[s]"</p>
        <p>"the roof contains the most critical information for engineers because they use it to balance the trade-offs when addressing customer benefits"</p>
        <p>"The team seeks consensus on these evaluations, basing them on expert engineering experi-<br/>ence, customer responses, and tabulated data from statistical studies or controlled experiments.</p>
        <p>"In many Japanese projects, the interfunctional team begins with the CAs and generates measurable characteristics for each, like foot-pounds of energy required to close the door."</p>
        <p>"For engineers [the House of Quality] is a way to summarize basic data in usable form. For marketing executives it represents the customer’s voice. General managers use it to discover strategic opportunities. Indeed, the house encourages all of these groups to work together to understand one another’s priorities and goals."</p>
        <p>"None of this is simple. An elegant idea ultimately decays into process, and processes will be confounding as long as human beings are involved. But that is no excuse to hold back."</p>
