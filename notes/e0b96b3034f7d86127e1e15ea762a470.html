        <p>"The first computer was developed by Charles Babbage. It cost more than a locomotive and did not work properly. Even though everyone tells us that computers are now "more powerful," the basic story does not seem to have changed."</p>
        <p>"It is well known that designers often design for themselves unless they have been trained to realize that people are diverse, and that users are unlikely to be like them. In computing, the design problem is exacerbated because designers, who are self-selected to be computer competent, are typically many times better at using computers than everyone else. In contrast, in any other common area of design--say, designing chairs--the designers would be unlikely to have such special and distinctive skills that marked them out as so different from everyone else. Who is so good at, say, sitting that they might underestimate how hard everyone else finds using chairs?"</p>
