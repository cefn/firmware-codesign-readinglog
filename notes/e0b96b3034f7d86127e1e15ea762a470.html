    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"The first computer was developed by Charles Babbage. It cost more than a
      locomotive and did not work properly. Even though everyone tells us that
      computers are now "more powerful," the basic story does not seem to have
      changed."</p>
    <p>"It is well known that designers often design for themselves unless they
      have been trained to realize that people are diverse, and that users are
      unlikely to be like them. In computing, the design problem is exacerbated
      because designers, who are self-selected to be computer competent, are
      typically many times better at using computers than everyone else. In
      contrast, in any other common area of design--say, designing chairs--the
      designers would be unlikely to have such special and distinctive skills
      that marked them out as so different from everyone else. Who is so good
      at, say, sitting that they might underestimate how hard everyone else
      finds using chairs?"</p>
