      "The relevant functions of sketching found in theory are: 1)
      supporting<br/>
      a re-interpretive cycle in the individual thinking process, 2) supporting
      re-<br/>
      interpretation of each other’s ideas in group activity, and 3)
      enhancing<br/>
      access to earlier ideas."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Design thinking researchers regard this activity of<br/>
      sketching as a means to spur creative thought."
    </p>
        <p>
      "The interaction that designers have with their sketches is seen as
      essential to creativity in<br/>
      design activity"
    </p>
        <p>
      "In his book ‘Engineering and the mind’s eye’, Ferguson (1992)
      identifies<br/>
      three kinds of sketches, which may be useful for identifying the role
      of<br/>
      sketches in creative design groups: the <em>
                <strong>thinking
      sketch,</strong>
            </em> the <em>
                <strong>talking<br/>
      sketch,</strong>
            </em> and the <em>
                <strong>prescriptive
      sketch</strong>
            </em>...<em>Thinking sketches</em> refer to the<br/>
      designers making use of the drawing surface in support of their<br/>
      individual thinking processes...‘to focus and guide nonverbal thinking’
      (p. 97). <em>Talking sketches</em> refer to designers making use of the
      (shared) drawing surface in<br/>
      support of the group discussion." [my emphasis]
    </p>
        <p>
      "We will refer to this category of<br/>
      sketches as ‘<em>
                <strong>storing sketches</strong>
            </em>’: Storing
      sketches refer to the designers<br/>
      using the drawing surface to archive design ideas for their own
      future<br/>
      reference. <em>
                <strong>Storing sketches</strong>
            </em> have much in common
      with <em>
                <strong>prescriptive<br/>
      sketches</strong>
            </em>. They both freeze, rather than develop, design
      ideas. However,<br/>
      the purpose of these two types of sketches is quite different. The
      storing<br/>
      sketch is intended for retaining information, whereas the
      prescriptive<br/>
      sketch is intended for communicating information."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Various researchers propose...cyclical models of re-interpretation, each
      with a slightly different connotation, ranging<br/>
      from a dialectic type of argumentation between seeing-as and
      seeing-that<br/>
      (Goldschmidt, 1991), interactive conversations with the paper on
      which<br/>
      the designer draws (Schon and Wiggins, 1992) and movement from<br/>
      description to depiction (Fish and Scrivener, 1990). In order to
      provide<br/>
      a general understanding of this re-interpretative process, these
      various<br/>
      perspectives will be described briefly"
