    <p>
      A great deal of the positioning seems to come from a Coyne paper
      concerning the hermeneutics (Heidegger) of design - which I can't get
      access to.

    <p>
      "three candidate accounts from design theory of what design ‘is’ are
      introduced; the conservative, the romantic, and the pragmatic"
    </p>
    <p>
      "HCI...does not recognize itself as a design discipline"
    </p>
    <p>
      "we examine in detail the concept of sketching as the archetypal activity
      of the design approach, and how it helps us grasp design work more
      properly as a kind of dialogue"
    </p>
    <p>
      "design is a matter of making; it is an attitude to research that
      involves the researcher in creating and giving form to something not
      previously there"
    </p>
    <p>
      "design-orientation by definition implies a commitment to technology and
      technological development that goes beyond critique"
    </p>
    <p>
      "the conservative account assumes that there is a ‘problem’ to be solved,
      and that descriptions of this problem can be comprehensively and
      accurately produced, if possible in the form of a structured requirements
      specification... ...A good designer in this tradition is someone who is
      able to follow prescribed action. This tends to deemphasize the role of
      the designer, striving towards a disembodied design process built on
      structured methods and externalized guidelines rather than on the skills
      and judgment of individual designers"
    </p>
    <p>
      "the romantic account of design gives prominence to the role of the
      designer. Here, they are seen as imaginative masterminds equipped with
      almost magical abilities of creation... ...In its emphasis on the
      individual, romanticism understands the key human abilities to be
      imagination over abstract reasoning and creativity over rational problem
      solving. Designers are seen as creative individuals with unusual talents,
      who often have to fight opposition in order to defend their unique
      creativity and artistic freedom... ...Hence, the romantic
      account...trades in creativity and individuality over methodology and
      control, aesthetics and individual judgment over transparency and logical
      reasoning. The content of design (the product) and the human creator (the
      designer) are accentuated, whereas the process of producing the product
      is opaque."
    </p>
    <p>
      "According to the pragmatic account, design is about being engaged
      directly in a specific design situation. It holds that design is always
      carried out somewhere in particular. This ‘situatedness’ locates the
      design process in a world which is already crammed with people,
      artifacts, and practices, each with their own histories, identities,
      goals, and plans.... ...design takes the form of a hermeneutic process
      of<br />
      interpretation and creation of meaning, where designers iteratively
      interpret the effects of their designs on the situation at hand. It is a
      reflective conversation with the materials of the design situation"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The traditional conception of the design process, strongly rooted in the
      conservative account, is to envision design work as divided into three
      distinct stages. The designer, according to this view, should first be
      involved in analyzing a problem, then in synthesizing a solution, and
      finally in evaluating the outcome... ...This layout of the design process
      has been and still is highly influential, especially for approaching
      design in the engineering disciplines."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To contrast the problems of the structured design methods, some have
      advocated the use of less formal, so-called ‘second generation’ design
      methods. [5,6] These methods—which include such activities as workshops,
      brainstorm sessions, synectics, checklists, and the use of specific
      environments to nurture creativity or for improving collaborative design
      [8, 26]—are intended to assist designers to collaborate and to be
      creative, rather than to systematize and formalize design work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jones [20] and Alexander [2], the founders of the <em><strong>design
      methodology movement</strong></em>, acknowledge problems with the design
      methods. While still claiming the need for such methods, Jones notes that
      there “is not much evidence that they have been used with success, even
      by their inventors.”"
    </p>
    <p>
      "SKETCHING AS ARCHETYPAL DESIGN ACTIVITY<br />
      To better capture and understand the nature of design work,<br />
      it becomes necessary to consider what is in this paper<br />
      proposed as an archetypical activity performed in all design<br />
      work, namely sketching. Here, sketching will not be<br />
      regarded primarily as a useful tool, technique, or skill that<br />
      is available to designers, but rather as the way in which<br />
      designers think. After the importance of sketching has been<br />
      established, it will follow to come to consider design more<br />
      as a dialogue than as a set of rigid and transparent<br />
      processes. In laying out these fundamentals, aspects that by<br />
      some might be considered ‘unscientific’ or ‘irrational’—<br />
      and which as such generally appear to be problematic<br />
      elements in research processes—will emerge as being at the<br />
      heart of design-orientation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The design process tends to remain implicit as<br />
      researchers are embarrassed by not being able to show<br />
      evidence of the same kind of control, structure,<br />
      predictability, and rigorousness in doing design as they are<br />
      able to show in other parts of their research."
