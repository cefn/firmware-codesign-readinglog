      "Meta-design is grounded in the basic assumption that future uses and
      problems cannot be completely anticipated at design time, when a system
      is developed. Users, at use time, will discover mismatches between their
      needs and the support that an existing system can provide for them.
      Meta-design extends boundaries by supporting users as active contributors
      who can transcend the functionality and content of existing systems. By
      facilitating these possibilities, control is distributed among all
      stakeholders in the design process."
