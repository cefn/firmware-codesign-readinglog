    <p>"[Mumford] believed that neither change nor management are ends in
      themselves. Management needs to consider ethical<br>
      and social issues that are intrinsically linked to all social change. In
      order to be able to manage change in an acceptable<br>
      manner, participation of those who are affected by it should be
      encouraged. Participation in decision making, in particular<br>
      regarding the design and use of technology, should lead to greater
      employee satisfaction and higher productivity, and<br>
      better use of local knowledge, thereby furthering employers' goals."</p>
    <p>"Socio-technical systems design provides a new worldview of what
      constitutes quality of working life and humanism at<br>
      work. It facilitates organizational innovation by recommending the removal
      of many elite groups and substituting flatter<br>
      hierarchies, multiskilling and group decision-taking. It wants to replace
      tight controls, bureaucracy and stress with an<br>
      organization and technology that enhances human freedom, democracy and
      creativity" (credited to Mumford, 2003 p. 262).</p>
    <p>"the critical intention is normative in that it aims to change the way we
      act. This normative intention cannot result from mere observation of the
      world. Critical research, therefore, must implicitly contain a normative
      premise that is based on some sort of ethical foundation."</p>
