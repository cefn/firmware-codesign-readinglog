      "Action research is simply a form of self-reflective enquiry
      undertaken<br/>
      by participants in social situations in order to improve the
      rationality<br/>
      and justice of their own practices, their understanding of these
      practices,<br/>
      and the situations in which the practices are carried out."
    </p>
        <p>
      "In terms of method, a self-reflective spiral of cycles of
      planning,<br/>
      acting, observing and reflecting is central to the action research<br/>
      approach."
