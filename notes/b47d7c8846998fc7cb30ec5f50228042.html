      "This article describes the deficiencies of positivist science for
      generating knowledge for use in solving problems that members of
      organizations face. Action research is presented as a method for
      generating knowledge that corrects these deficiencies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Criteria and methods of science appropriate to action research are
      offered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The term 'action research ' was introduced by Kurt Lewin in 1946 to
      denote a pioneering approach toward social research which combined
      generation of theory with changing the social system through the
      researcher acting on or in the social system. The act itself is presented
      as the means of both changing the system and generating critical
      knowledge about it."
