        <p>
            <div>In the chapters that follow visual-ising is variously apprehended as a compounding of strategies for knowing, for desiring and for the exercise of power. That is to say that all of the authors gathered here are interested in the social context of both the ‘seeing’ and the ‘seen’ but also with the intentionality of the practices that relate these two moments. In this sense the work is collectively concerned with a cultural process rather than with a descriptive category such as ‘visual culture’ has come to represent.</div>
