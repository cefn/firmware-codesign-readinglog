        <div>"The sequential ordering does not hold for tangible interaction, where activities happen in parallel, where the activity can be distributed across multiple devices and places. The third issue is that in tangible interaction, the physical properties, characteristics, surfaces and forms of the tangible suggest its use and use possibilities."</div>

        <div>"The everyday skill, or coping as Dreyfus describes, is central to what we are familiar with. The familiarity with the world is not a skill that sometimes is used, and sometimes not. It is active all the time. Hence, to be a user in the first place is to be familiar with some- thing. We do not activate this most general skill only on certain occasions, it is active all the time. Heidegger calls this capacity â€œthe sight of practical circumspec- tion. . . , our practical everyday orientation"</div>

        <div>"These three concepts; involvement, understanding and unity of user-world are, according to Turner, ideas that we can use in order to investigate familiarity."</div>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <div>They investigate familiarity as a design dimension for Ubicomp/IoT. They start with a form factor "cushions, [which] communicate wirelessly with each other" which have graphics, light and music outputs and bendable wings and microphones for input..."in order to motivate different interpre- tations and forms of interaction"</div>
