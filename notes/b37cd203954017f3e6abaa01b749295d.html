    <p>"Another very interesting category we may include in Brazil's <em>jeitinho</em>
      culture is that of "<em>gambiarra</em>," which is a kind of a
      nonprofessional, cheap, and quick repair or mending (Paulielo, 1984). <em>Gambiarra</em>
      as a rule "breaks up" in very improper circumstances because the
      definitive arrangement is always posponed. In this way a provisional
      solution becomes a permanent one, despite the risks in its adoption."</p>
    <p><br>
      "Brazilians use <em>gambiarras</em> to patch up cars, utilities and even
      the federal constitution, because it is easier to make a quick repair than
      it is to give a matter some more thought. In a positive interpretation, <em>gambiarra</em>
      reflects flexibility"</p>
