        <p>"Another very interesting category we may include in Brazil's<em>jeitinho</em>culture is that of "<em>gambiarra</em>," which is a kind of a nonprofessional, cheap, and quick repair or mending (Paulielo, 1984).<em>Gambiarra</em>as a rule "breaks up" in very improper circumstances because the definitive arrangement is always posponed. In this way a provisional solution becomes a permanent one, despite the risks in its adoption."</p>
