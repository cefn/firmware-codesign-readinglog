    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"Designers have been moving increasingly closer to the future users of
      what they design and the next new thing in the changing landscape of
      design research has become co-designing with your users."</p>
    <p>"The first advances, well consolidated now in industrial practice and
      education, practiced user-centred design from an ‘expert perspective’ in
      which trained researchers observe and/or interview largely passive users,
      whose contribution is to perform instructed tasks and/or to give their
      opinions about product concepts that were generated by others.</p>
    <p>"The application of participatory design practices (both at the moment of
      idea generation and continuing throughout the design process at all key
      moments of decision) to very large-scale problems will change design and
      may change the world."</p>
