        <p>"[Object Oriented Analysis] adopts ideas from object-oriented programming and blends them with ideas from semantic data modeling and knowledge representation (notably semantic networks) into a aspects of a software system. Today, there are dozens of like-minded techniques and commercial tools modeling framework that is more powerful founded on the OO way of thinking that support than traditional techniques such as data flow diagrams, structured analysis, and the like."</p>
        <p>"The Object-Oriented Systems Analysis (OOSA) technique [12] adopts the Entity-Relationship (ER) model to capture the declarative aspects of a software system."</p>
