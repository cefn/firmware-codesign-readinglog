    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>First heard about this technique through Radio 4 'Life Scientific'
      programme. Uses replay of actual recorded conversations to lead people
      through more authentic role-play scenarios. Strong relationship with
      leading paraglider pilots through logged flights as scenario generation
      and engagement strategy.</p>
    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>Conversational analysis</p>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"The people in the training workshop live through the call as it happened
      without knowing what's going to happen next. I show them what happens
      next."</p>
    <p>"if you can't intuit what you would do in a situation, how can you
      construct an entire hypothetical role play and make it look anythying like
      the situation you're really going to deal with?" </p>
