        <p>
      A totally amazing paragraph starting "Recent literature", on page 176,
      which summarises schemes, frames, scripts, paradigms etc. as models of
      shared cognitive structures. This single paragraph seems to cite almost
      all the relevant authors which are relevant to the space (at the time of
      writing).

      "we build on and extend research into the cognitions and values of users
      and designers by proposint a systematic approach for examining the
      underlying assumptions, expectations and knowledge that people have about
      technology...We suggest that where the tecnological frames of key groups
      in organizations - such as managers, technologists, and users - are
      significantly different, difficulties and conflict around the
      development, use and change of technology may result....We argue that
      technological frames offer an interesting and userful analytic
      perspective for explaining and anticipating actions and meanings that are
      not easily obtained with other theoretical lenses."
    </p>
        <p>
      "to interact with technology, people have to make sense of it; and in
      this sense-making process, they develop particular assumptions,
      expectations, and knowledge of the technology, which then serve to shape
      subsequent actions toward it. While these interpretations become
      taken-for-granted and are rarely brought to the surface and reflected on,
      they nevertheless remain significant in influencing how actors in
      organizations think about and act toward technology."
    </p>
        <p>
      "different groups within an organization may have different technological
      fdrames, and [we] introduce the notion of congruence to describe the
      nature and extent of differences among frames"
    </p>
        <p>
      "the findings [of a field study] reveal significant differences in the
      technological frames of two primary groups - technologists and users. The
      incongruence in frames provides an interesting explanation of the
      difficulties and unanticipated outcomes associated with the technology
      implementation."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Frames refer to "definitions of organiszational reality that serve as
      vehicles for understanding and action"....[and] include assumptions,
      knowledge and expectations, expressed symbolically through language,
      visual images, metaphors and stories....structured as webs of meanings"
