        <p>"In selecting more than one case, the usual<br/>procedure is to design a tentative model based on the results of the first studied case, and to adjust the resulting model when and where necessary while studying the other cases, until the designed model fits all cases. Alternatively, we may discover that different models are necessary to fit different cases, depending on certain conditions. But the focus is on the description and explanation of developments<br/>within one case."</p>
