      "In selecting more than one case, the usual<br/>
      procedure is to design a tentative model based on the results of the
      first studied case, and to adjust the resulting model when and where
      necessary while studying the other cases, until the designed model fits
      all cases. Alternatively, we may discover that different models are
      necessary to fit different cases, depending on certain conditions. But
      the focus is on the description and explanation of developments<br/>
      within one case."
