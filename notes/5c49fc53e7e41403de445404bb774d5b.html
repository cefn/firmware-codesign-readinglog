        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>Incredibly close to my own focus (at least when considering using workshops without prepared boundary objects). Looking at elective representations by users would be a fantastic way to identify underlying regularities just as David Hendry does.</p>
        <p>Really clear taxonomy of icon components within diagrams, and covers modelling cases such as UML. It is a very cool paper and well worth reading a few times.</p>

        <p>"To explore how people conceptualize a complex system,<br/>232 university students were asked to sketch how a search<br/>engine works."</p>
        <p>"Finally, the conceptual metaphor can be used as a design<br/>tool for outlining a plan for implementing a computational<br/>process in a formal data flow language [22]. When it is used<br/>in this fashion, a key question is whether and how the<br/>association between the informal and formal representations<br/>is maintained. While this has been recognized as an<br/>important issue [20, 23], the benefits and costs of<br/>maintaining correspondences between a sketch and a<br/>computational process or formal model are not well<br/>understood." [this is a key statement, but I skipped a lot of great stuff which needs capturing before this]</p>
