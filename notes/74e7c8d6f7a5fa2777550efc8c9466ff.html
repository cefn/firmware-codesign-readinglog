      "The user’s needs form a complex of expectations, previous usage
      experiences, and emotional variables that should be integrated into the
      system design. It is indeed fundamental to embody the variations in usage
      expectations, and experiences that are established among individuals
      throughout their interactions with the tools and the environment. This
      work adopts the notion of aesthetics of interaction in order to
      investigate these issues."

    <p>
      "In many senses, the perspective of the aesthetics of interaction can be
      considered as a means of facilitating the way in which computation is
      manifested in a system’s design, and overcoming some of the traditional
      problems of ubiquitous, ambient, and pervasive computing which cause
      computation to become invisible, with subsequent loss of control on the
      part of the user [Petersen 2004;Tolmie et al. 2002; Weiser 1993, 1991;
      Weiser and Seely Brown 1996]."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This implies that a perspective<br />
      that is exclusively focused on user involvement does not allow for a
      complete<br />
      comprehension and therefore for an effective representation of all of
      those vari-<br />
      ables playing a role. Complementary design strategies should be
      identified to<br />
      effectively collect people’s composite needs and to transform them into
      accurate<br />
      design requirements, in this way experimenting with new modalities for
      user<br />
      participation and expression."
    </p>
    <p>
      "making latent variables explicit can anticipate<br />
      problems occurring in the interaction with the designed system and can
      help<br />
      with the process of acceptance when introducing new technological
      equipment"
