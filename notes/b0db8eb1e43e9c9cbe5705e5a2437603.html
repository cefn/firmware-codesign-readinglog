        <p>"The experiences of real people concerning real product use situations are of great value for designers especially during the earlier phases of the design<br/>process. Such information needs be practically useful during idea generation. We believe that this can be realised if the tool supports communication through three qualities: by enhancing empathy, by providing inspiration, and by supporting engagement. We have developed a tool to make the receivers of the information, the designers, participative in the act of communicating. In this way they become co-creators and co-owners of the information, which may result in higher degrees of acceptance and use."</p>
