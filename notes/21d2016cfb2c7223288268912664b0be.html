    <p>"This paper discusses the impact of tools on MDE adoption and places
      tooling within a broader organizational context."</p>
    <p>"[some are] interested in how individuals use tools and, in particular,
      how to design tools that are intuitive and seamless to use. This reflects
      a Heideggerian difference between tools that are ‘ready to hand’ (they
      fade into the background) and ‘present at hand’ (focus is on the tool to
      the detriment of the ‘real’ issue). "</p>
    <p>"current tools are a barrier to success rather than an enabler"</p>
    <p>"Our interviewees emphasized tool immaturity, complexity and lack of
      usability as major barriers....tools are often very powerful, but it is
      too difficult for users to access that power; or, in some cases, they do
      not really need that power and require something much simpler."</p>
    <p>"These examples hint at a more fundamental problem, which appears to be
      true of textual modeling tools as well: a lack of consideration for how
      people work and think: “basically it’s still the mindset that the human
      adapts to the computer, not vice-versa.”"</p>
    <p>"current tools have focused on automating solutions once a problem has
      been solved. In contrast, scant attention has been paid to supporting the
      problem solving process itself"</p>
    <p>"It is ironic that MDE was introduced to help deal with the essential
      complexity of systems, but in many cases, adds accidental complexity."
      [referencing Brooks]</p>
    <p>"one company used MDE where the user interface was not so critical:
      “cases which are internal applications. . . where the user interface is
      not such an issue . . . that’s where you get the maximum productivity from
      a tool like ours.”"</p>
    <p>"Our interviews show that the tool market is focused only on supporting
      models at an abstraction level very close to code, where the mapping to
      code is straightforward. This is clearly somewhat removed from the MDE
      vision. Unfortunately, there is also a clear gap in the way that vendors
      market their tools and their real capabilities in terms of this low-level
      approach."</p>
    <p>"roughly speaking, software architects tend to embrace MDE tools because
      they can encode their architectural rules and easily mandate that others
      follow them. Code ‘gurus’, or those highly expert programmers in a
      project, tend to avoid MDE tools as they can take away some of their
      control. Similarly, ‘hobbyist programmers’, those nine-to-fivers who
      nevertheless like to go home and read about new programming techniques,
      also tend to avoid MDE because it risks taking away their creativity."</p>
    <p>"At Volvo, the automotive standard AUTOSAR 3 has made the choice of
      development tool a non-issue; Simulink is the standard tool: “. . . a
      language which makes it possible to communicate across the disciplinary
      borders. That the system architect, the engineer and the tester actually
      understand what they see.”"</p>
    <p>"the domain experts trust the tools to deliver: “I do like it. In quite a
      lot of ways. Especially for the kind of software we are developing. It’s
      not like rocket science, really. It’s like systems where you have a few
      signals in, you should make a few decisions, make some kind of output. It
      is not that difficult applications. There are no complex algorithms. . .
      And for that I think Simulink is very sufficient. . . I like it.”"</p>
    <p>"when searching for tool-specific help on UML, “you basically come up
      empty-handed.”"</p>
    <p>"Match tools to people, not the other way around. Most MDE tools are
      developed by those with a technical background but without in-depth
      experience of human-computer interaction or business issues."</p>
