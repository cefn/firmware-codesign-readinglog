      "Learning to program can be very difficult for beginners of all ages. In
      addition to the challenges of learning to form struc-<br />
      tured solutions to problems and understanding how programs are executed,
      beginning programmers also have to learn a<br />
      rigid syntax and rigid commands that may have seemingly arbitrary or
      perhaps confusing names."
