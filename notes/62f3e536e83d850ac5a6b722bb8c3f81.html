        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>They follow through a procurement process to try and figure out where the usability part happens and who has responsibility for it (supplier or procurer). They find that it falls between the gaps, and propose engaging much earlier with the 'how' and usability questions, and engaging professionals to do so, because the procurement staff, untrained in usability, found confronting usability issues hard .</p>

        <p>"Difficulties also arose because the tools that they used were based on idealized models of how users worked."</p>
        <p>"Procurers, on the other hand, have relied on suppliers to create usable systems and have not focused explicitly on usability issues in their procurements (Holmlid &amp; Artman, this<br/>volume). Unfortunately, although<em>it might seem obvious to expect that the system you purchase should be usable and useful this is seldom the case</em>. An important reason is that usability issues have not been dealt with consciously in organisations or projects and have been separated in development processes" [my italics]</p>
        <p>"another reason why usability activities are often omitted in contract development is that the activities do not seem to add much to what has already been done in the procurement, even though this work may not have focused on actual use at all"</p>
        <p>"the user-centred design process can be seen as divided into two stages. The first stage, the “what” stage, aims at defining what kind of system and functionality that will solve identified user needs. The second stage, the “how” stage, addresses how the interaction with the identified functionality should be designed."</p>
