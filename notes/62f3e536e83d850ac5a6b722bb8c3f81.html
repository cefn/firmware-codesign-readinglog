    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>They follow through a procurement process to try and figure out where the
      usability part happens and who has responsibility for it (supplier or
      procurer). They find that it falls between the gaps, and propose engaging
      much earlier with the 'how' and usability questions, and engaging
      professionals to do so, because the procurement staff, untrained in
      usability, found confronting usability issues hard .</p>
    <h2>Field of Study</h2>
    <p>User-Oriented Design, Procurement, </p>

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"Difficulties also arose because the tools that they used were based on
      idealized models of how users worked."</p>
    <p>"Procurers, on the other hand, have relied on suppliers to create usable
      systems and have not focused explicitly on usability issues in their
      procurements (Holmlid &amp; Artman, this<br>
      volume). Unfortunately, although <em>it might seem obvious to expect that
        the system you purchase should be usable and useful this is seldom the
        case</em>. An important reason is that usability issues have not been
      dealt with consciously in organisations or projects and have been
      separated in development processes" [my italics]</p>
    <p>"another reason why usability activities are often omitted in contract
      development is that the activities do not seem to add much to what has
      already been done in the procurement, even though this work may not have
      focused on actual use at all"</p>
    <p>"the user-centred design process can be seen as divided into two stages.
      The first stage, the “what” stage, aims at defining what kind of system
      and functionality that will solve identified user needs. The second stage,
      the “how” stage, addresses how the interaction with the identified
      functionality should be designed."</p>
