        Software Requirements Comic Book Style</a></h1>
    <h2>Authors</h2>
    <p>Amanda M. Williams, Thomas A. Alspaugh</p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Argue for a specific form of information presentation, which draws on
      various advantages of disclosure identified in Comic Books (citing McCloud
      a lot).</p>
    <h2>Field of Study</h2>
    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>Anton and Potts (among others) have pointed out what is perhaps the
      central problem of requirements: </p>
    <blockquote>"Stakeholders seldom understand their requirements fully at the
      beginning of a project. They often lack a clear vision of what the system
      should do and change their minds during development. In general,
      stakeholders only become more sure about what they want when they see a
      system that does not exhibit the necessary features."</blockquote>
