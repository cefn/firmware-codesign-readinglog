        <h2>Quotations</h2>
        <p>"The form in which information is presented affects how well it is understood and by whom, the ease of identifying problems and missing information, and the facility with which adjustments and corrections can be made"</p>
        <p>"Working with requirements in comic book style provides affordances, absent or weaker in other requirements forms, that may assist stakeholders in surfacing and expressing desires sooner and developers in understanding them and each other"</p>
        <p>Anton and Potts (among others) have pointed out what is perhaps the central problem of requirements:</p>
        <blockquote>"Stakeholders seldom understand their requirements fully at the beginning of a project. They often lack a clear vision of what the system should do and change their minds during development. In general, stakeholders only become more sure about what they want when they see a system that does not exhibit the necessary features."</blockquote>
        <p>"Missing requirements are particularly difficult to identify and address. Scenarios can help stakeholders identify missing requirements, but as many researchers have noted people are better at identifying errors of commission (“that behavior of the system is wrong”) than errors of omission (“the system should do this but doesn’t”)."<br/>
            <br/>"Comics exhibit characteristics that may encourage stakeholder engagement in requirements engineering, and foster a productive imagination around how scenarios might play out. They also exhibit an intersection of various narrative practices that can help members of interdisciplinary project teams communicate about their work."<br/>
            <br/>"While it seems clear to us that comics-style requirements can be created (indeed, the figures for this paper show several small examples), we need to explore and evaluate how they may be useful in requirements work."<br/>
