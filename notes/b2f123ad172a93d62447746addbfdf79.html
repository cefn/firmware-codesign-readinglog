    <h2>Relevance</h2>
    <p>Lovely picture of a toaster on the front cover. Worth scrolling through
      to find examples of prototyping practice.</p>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"The goal of this book is to prepare you for a real embedded systems
      project by<br>
      walking you through an entire embedded systems design. Not coincidentally,
      the<br>
      project source code included is a piece of firmware — an embedded boot
      platform<br>
      — that can simplify all your future projects."</p>
    <p>"Several chapters cover the basic steps of starting up an embedded system
      and<br>
      getting a working application (including the basic boot in assembler),
      exception<br>
      handling, flash memory drivers, a flash file system, and serial and
      Ethernet<br>
      connections. The result is an understanding of how an embedded systems
      project gets<br>
      started and how to build a platform on which an embedded systems
      application can<br>
      reside."</p>
    <p>"The intent of this book is not to<br>
      discuss the latest superscalar architecture or the antenna effects of
      copper routes<br>
      on a printed circuit board, nor does it present a high-level abstract
      design process."</p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>PDF version of a full book, but weirdly rendered - contents pages are
      wrong. Still, it creates searchable text.</p>
