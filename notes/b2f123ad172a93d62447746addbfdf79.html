        <p>Lovely picture of a toaster on the front cover. Worth scrolling through to find examples of prototyping practice.</p>
        <h2>Quotations</h2>
        <p>"The goal of this book is to prepare you for a real embedded systems project by<br/>walking you through an entire embedded systems design. Not coincidentally, the<br/>project source code included is a piece of firmware — an embedded boot platform<br/>— that can simplify all your future projects."</p>
        <p>"Several chapters cover the basic steps of starting up an embedded system and<br/>getting a working application (including the basic boot in assembler), exception<br/>handling, flash memory drivers, a flash file system, and serial and Ethernet<br/>connections. The result is an understanding of how an embedded systems project gets<br/>started and how to build a platform on which an embedded systems application can<br/>reside."</p>
        <p>"The intent of this book is not to<br/>discuss the latest superscalar architecture or the antenna effects of copper routes<br/>on a printed circuit board, nor does it present a high-level abstract design process."</p>
