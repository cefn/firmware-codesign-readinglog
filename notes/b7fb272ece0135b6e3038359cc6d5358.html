        <p>"[design] studies are rhetorical...because they treat design as a mediating agency of influence between designers and their intended audience"</p>
        <p>"There is a general attitude that technology is only an applied science, rather than a part of design art, and this approach has led many to abandon hope that technology can be seriously influenced and guided by human values and a discernment of beneficial ends in the human community"</p>
        <p>"In almost every area of design, we encounter objects that<br/>have a strange and startling unfamiliarity that may provoke or<br/>even repel us. Although such reactions may suggest that the public<br/>lacks critical awareness about the nature of design, they also indi-<br/>cate a new weakness in design communication"</p>
        <p>"if technology is in some fundamental sense concerned with the probable rather than the necessary - with the contingencies of practical use and action, rather than the certainties of scientific principle - then it becomes rhetorical in a startling fashion. It<br/>becomes an art of deliberation about the issues of practical action,<br/>and its scientific aspect is, in a sense, only incidental, except as it<br/>forms part of an argument in favor of one or another solution to a<br/>specific practical problem" £ articulates the methodological positioning of prototyping firmware blueprints as a category of research"</p>
        <p>"Design is.an art of thought directed to practical action through the persuasiveness of objects and, therefore, design involves the vivid expression of competing<br/>ideas about social life."</p>
        <p>"For decades, technologists have tried to persuade audiences of the expediency of their inventions and discoveries, producing objects that often seem to meet human needs and promote a better, well-ordered life. Yet, the life they have promoted has frequently proven to be harmful and discordant with<br/>human values. The concern is not with the outright failures of technological reasoning, but with those instances in which the result has been an inhuman mechanical order or even a frustrating disorder and social chaos" £ inhuman mechanical order, sums up nicely what bad firmware delivers"</p>
        <p>"design is a debate among opposing views about such matters as technology, practical life, the place of emotion and expression in the living environment, and a host of other concerns that make up the texture of postmodern, postindustrial living."<br/>
