    "[design] studies are rhetorical...because they treat design as a mediating
    agency of influence between designers and their intended audience"
    <p>"There is a general attitude that technology is only an applied science,
      rather than a part of design art, and this approach has led many to
      abandon hope that technology can be seriously influenced and guided by
      human values and a discernment of beneficial ends in the human community"</p>
    <p>"In almost every area of design, we encounter objects that<br>
      have a strange and startling unfamiliarity that may provoke or<br>
      even repel us. Although such reactions may suggest that the public<br>
      lacks critical awareness about the nature of design, they also indi-<br>
      cate a new weakness in design communication"</p>
    <p>"if technology is in some fundamental sense concerned with the probable
      rather than the necessary - with the contingencies of practical use and
      action, rather than the certainties of scientific principle - then it
      becomes rhetorical in a startling fashion. It<br>
      becomes an art of deliberation about the issues of practical action,<br>
      and its scientific aspect is, in a sense, only incidental, except as it<br>
      forms part of an argument in favor of one or another solution to a<br>
      specific practical problem" £ articulates the methodological positioning
      of prototyping firmware blueprints as a category of research"</p>
    <p>"Design is.an art of thought directed to practical action through the
      persuasiveness of objects and, therefore, design involves the vivid
      expression of competing<br>
      ideas about social life."</p>
    <p>"For decades, technologists have tried to persuade audiences of the
      expediency of their inventions and discoveries, producing objects that
      often seem to meet human needs and promote a better, well-ordered life.
      Yet, the life they have promoted has frequently proven to be harmful and
      discordant with<br>
      human values. The concern is not with the outright failures of
      technological reasoning, but with those instances in which the result has
      been an inhuman mechanical order or even a frustrating disorder and social
      chaos" £ inhuman mechanical order, sums up nicely what bad firmware
      delivers"</p>
    <p>"design is a debate among opposing views about such matters as
      technology, practical life, the place of emotion and expression in the
      living environment, and a host of other concerns that make up the texture
      of postmodern, postindustrial living."<br>
