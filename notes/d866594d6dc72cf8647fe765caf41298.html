      "This paper reports the results of a study that identified...active
      ingredients<br/>
      through an analysis of 172 idea-generation methods"
    </p>
        <p>
      "Fifty idea-generation devices of three types - strategies, tactics,
      and<br/>
      enablers - were identified and organized in a formulary.<br/>
      Research results facilitate the evaluation of idea-generation<br/>
      methods and the selection of methods suited to particular idea-<br/>
      generation tasks."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Active ingredients may be instructions users can mentally discharge
      (e.g., fantasize), stimuli they can respond t o (e.g., visual displays),
      or conditions fostering<br/>
      idea generation (e.g., anonymity)."
    </p>
        <p>
      "with the Moment to Moment technique, one visualizes, in detail, what
      would happen if a n idea was put into action. The most radical
      imagina-<br/>
      tion-based strategy, identification, requires people to imaginatively
      become a non-human part of the problem."
