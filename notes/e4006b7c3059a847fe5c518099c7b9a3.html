        <p>"A formal, domain-independent definition of design patterns allows for computer support without<br/>sacrificing readability, and pattern use is integrated into the usability engineering life cycle.<br/>As an example, experience from building an award-winning interactive music exhibit was<br/>turned into a pattern language, which was then used to inform follow-up projects and<br/>support HCI education"</p>
        <p>"it is difficult for the user<br/>interface designer to explain his guidelines and concerns to the other groups. It is<br/>often even more problematic to extract application domain concepts from the user<br/>representative in a usable form. And it is hard for HCI people, and for application<br/>domain experts even more so, to understand the architectural and technological<br/>constraints and rules that guide the systems engineer in the design process." Â£</p>
        <p>"We suggested that all team members - especially HCI people, software<br/>engineers, and experts from the application domain - formulate their experience,<br/>methods and values in the form of pattern languages, as originally introduced in<br/>urban architecture. For a uniform representation and computer support, we proposed<br/>a formal representation of patterns and their relations."</p>
