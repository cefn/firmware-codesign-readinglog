    <p>"A formal, domain-independent definition of design patterns allows for
      computer support without<br>
      sacrificing readability, and pattern use is integrated into the usability
      engineering life cycle.<br>
      As an example, experience from building an award-winning interactive music
      exhibit was<br>
      turned into a pattern language, which was then used to inform follow-up
      projects and<br>
      support HCI education"</p>
    <p>"it is difficult for the user<br>
      interface designer to explain his guidelines and concerns to the other
      groups. It is<br>
      often even more problematic to extract application domain concepts from
      the user<br>
      representative in a usable form. And it is hard for HCI people, and for
      application<br>
      domain experts even more so, to understand the architectural and
      technological<br>
      constraints and rules that guide the systems engineer in the design
      process." £</p>
    <p>"We suggested that all team members - especially HCI people, software<br>
      engineers, and experts from the application domain - formulate their
      experience,<br>
      methods and values in the form of pattern languages, as originally
      introduced in<br>
      urban architecture. For a uniform representation and computer support, we
      proposed<br>
      a formal representation of patterns and their relations."</p>
