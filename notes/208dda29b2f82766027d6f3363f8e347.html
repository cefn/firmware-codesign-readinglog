        <p>"metadesign deals with the creation of context rather than content; it is a mode of integrating systems and setting actions in order to create environ-<br/>ments in which people may cultivate “creative conversations” and take control of the context of their cultural and aesthetic production"</p>
        <p>"According to De Kerckhove, metadesign is the kind of design that puts the tools rather than the object of design in the users’ hands, and defines the conditions for the process of interaction rather than the process itself."</p>
        <p>"metadesign can be described as the design of tools, parameters and operating conditions that allow an infinite flexibility in tailoring the industrial product and<br/>enable the end-user to take charge of the final design by choosing among many different options."</p>
