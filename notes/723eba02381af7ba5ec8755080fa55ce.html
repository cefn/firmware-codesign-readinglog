        Blueprinting: A Practical Technique for Service Innovation</a></h1>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Followed this thread to see if commonalities with Service Design (though
      not co-design in this case) means commentators draw on similar themes to
      that of Firmware. This is not only in terms of being overlooked, or
      considered too hard to model, but also perhaps techniques which could be
      transferred because of this parallel. Indeed I found a lot in common -
      with immateriality and temporality specifically flagged in ways which
      apply directly also to Firmware.</p>

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"Service(s) are fluid, dynamic, and frequently co-produced in real time
      by customers, employees, and technology, often with few static physical
      properties. Thus, many of the invention protocols and prototype design
      techniques used for physical goods, hard technologies, and software do not
      work well for human and interactive services, or at least they demand
      significant adaptation to address service innovation challenges"</p>
    <p>"The purpose of this article is to describe one such technique—service
      blueprinting—a customer-focused approach for service innovation and
      service improvement"</p>
    <p>"One of the most distinctive characteristics of services is their process
      nature. 10 Unlike physical goods, services are dynamic, unfolding over a
      period of time through a sequence or constellation of events and steps.
      The service process can be viewed as a chain or constellation of
      activities that allow the service to function effectively."</p>
    <p>"Service blueprints allow all members of the organization to visualize an
      entire service and its underlying support processes, providing common
      ground from which critical points of customer contact, physical evidence,
      and other key functional and emotional experience clues can be
      orchestrated."</p>
    <p>"What is needed is a means of presenting the activities, relationships,
      and interdependencies of a service process in an objective and precise
      manner such that it is methodologically structured, but flexible enough to
      allow creativity to flow."</p>
    <p>"During the final service design stages, the service concept is likely to
      be refined over a series of iterations to the point at which a final,
      comprehensive blueprint can be produced. All relevant parties should be
      involved in this process, including in many cases customers or clients.
      The ultimate task is for each functional area involved in delivering the
      service to translate the final blueprint into detailed implementation
      plans to support their activities within the blueprint. Departmental
      sub-processes can be magnified, rendered in fine detail, and blueprinted
      on their own as sub-documents of the main blueprint. The main blueprint
      forms a common point of reference for all parties concerned with achieving
      a successful launch of the service. It also serves as a focal point for
      later refinements or last-minute changes."</p>
    <p>"Service blueprinting... could help solve problems preemptively; and it
      was able to identify failure points in a service operation...[It] was
      further developed to distinguish between onstage and backstage activities.
      These key components still form the basis of the technique and its most
      important feature, that of illuminating the customer’s role in the service
      process."</p>
    <p>"service blueprinting is not as complex or as formal as some business
      process modeling tools such as UML. Service blueprints are<br>
      relatively simple and their graphical representations are easy for all
      stakeholders involved – customers, managers, front-line employees – to
      learn, use, and even modify to meet a particular innovation’s
      requirements."</p>
    <p>"There are five components of a typical service blueprint...<br>
      • Customer Actions,<br>
      • Onstage/Visible Contact Employee Actions,<br>
      • Backstage/Invisible Contact Employee Actions,<br>
      • Support Processes, and<br>
      • Physical Evidence."</p>
    <p>"Customer actions are depicted chronologically across the top of the
      blueprint...they are typically laid out first so that all other activities
      can be seen as supporting the value proposition offered to or co-created
      with the customer. The next critical component is the “onstage/visible
      contact employee actions,” separated from the customer by the line of
      interaction...The next significant component of the blueprint is the
      “backstage/invisible contact employee actions,” separated from the onstage
      actions by the very important line of visibility. Everything that appears
      above the line of visibility is seen by the customer, while everything
      below it is invisible...The fourth critical component of the blueprint is
      “support processes” separated from contact employees by the internal line
      of interaction"</p>
