    <p>"We examined 155 information systems research articles published from
      1983 to 1988 and found that although this research is not rooted in a
      single overarching theoretical perspective, it does exhibit a single set
      of philosophical assumptions regarding the nature of the phenomena studied
      by information systems researchers, and what constitutes valid knowledge
      about those phenomena. We believe that a single research perspective for
      studying information systems phenomena is unnecessarily restrictive, and
      argue that there exist other philosophical assumptions that can inform
      studies of the relationships between information technology, people, and
      organizations. In this paper, we present two additional research
      philosophies for consideration - the interpretive and the critical - and
      for each we provide empirical examples to illustrate how they are used."</p>
