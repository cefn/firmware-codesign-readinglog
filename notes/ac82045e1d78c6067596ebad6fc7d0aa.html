      Plenty more to be gleaned from this. Well written, referenced and clear.
      Worth reading more.

      "Many scholars are convinced that boundary objects (BOs) can play a key
      facilitating role<br />
      in inter-departmental problem solving. BOs are physical artifacts that
      provide a common<br />
      language and promote shared understanding about a problem or a situation
      among a group of<br />
      individuals to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution. For example, a
      medical chart in a<br />
      hospital is a physical artifact usually presented in a standardized
      format that serves as a BO."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much of the existing research on BOs examines their use in problem
      solving contexts<br />
      such as new product design and development (e.g., Bechky, 2003; Carlile,
      2002, 2004;<br />
      Henderson, 1991, 1995)."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yakura (2002) investigated the role of a Gantt chart (visual artifact
      to<br />
      represent a project timeline) as a temporal BO between an information
      technology (IT)<br />
      consultant and its client, a public utility company, in managing the
      progress of an IT project. The<br />
      Gantt chart became an effective temporal BO in interpretation and
      negotiation between the IT<br />
      consultant and its client."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bechky (2003), from her empirical research in a semiconductor equipment
      manufacturing<br />
      company, finds tangible BOs, such as prototypes, to be more effective
      than drawings in creating<br />
      common ground between two departments (design and assembly) because such
      objects invoke<br />
      the necessary elements of work context."
    </p>
    <p>
      "From these studies it appears that an appropriate BO in one setting can
      become a<br />
      boundary roadblock in another setting, even when the problem solving
      contexts are very similar,<br />
      i.e., producing a new product."
