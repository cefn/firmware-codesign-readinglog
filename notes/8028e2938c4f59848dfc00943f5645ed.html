        <p>"Fricke (1993, 1996), from protocol studies of engineering designers, found that<br/>both generating few alternative concepts and generating a large number of<br/>alternatives were equally weak strategies, leading to poor design solutions."</p>
        <p>"When the problem was precisely specified, designers generated more solution variants;<br/>whereas with an imprecise assignment (for the same design task), designers tended<br/>to generate few alternative solution concepts."</p>
