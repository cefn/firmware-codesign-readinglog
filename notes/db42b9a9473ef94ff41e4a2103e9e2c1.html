        <p>"Sketching research so far has focused on sketching in a<br/>particular phase in specific design domains. This paper draws on<br/>descriptions of design processes given by designers from a wide<br/>variety of domains, as part of a research project on comparisons<br/>across design domains."</p>
        <p>"Sketches are used as depictions of potential objects in idea generation, but also as thinking aids for<br/>reasoning about abstract concepts. They are used in those domains,<br/>such as software design, where there is no pictorial description of the<br/>product, but also in more visual design domains such as engineering<br/>design, to sketch out abstract properties."</p>
