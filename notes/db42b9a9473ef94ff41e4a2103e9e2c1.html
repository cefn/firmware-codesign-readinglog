    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"Sketching research so far has focused on sketching in a<br>
      particular phase in specific design domains. This paper draws on<br>
      descriptions of design processes given by designers from a wide<br>
      variety of domains, as part of a research project on comparisons<br>
      across design domains."</p>
    <p>"Sketches are used as depictions of potential objects in idea generation,
      but also as thinking aids for<br>
      reasoning about abstract concepts. They are used in those domains,<br>
      such as software design, where there is no pictorial description of the<br>
      product, but also in more visual design domains such as engineering<br>
      design, to sketch out abstract properties."</p>
