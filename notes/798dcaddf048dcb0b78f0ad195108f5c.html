    <p>"In this article, we demonstrate how a concept-driven approach can
      coexist, and be integrated with, common user-centered approaches to
      interaction design through the development of a model that makes explicit
      the existing cycle of prototyping, theory development, and user studies."</p>
    <p>"many readers probably recognize names like the DynaBook and
      ActiveBadges; these concepts are examples of highly influential research
      designs in the field of HCI. By “influential” we primarily mean that they
      have contributed to the intellectual and conceptual development of the
      field of HCI research and are frequently referred to as landmarks and as
      focal points on the interaction research theoretical map."</p>
    <p>"What is it that makes some concept designs more memorable and
      interesting than others? What makes them unique? How should we understand
      these concept designs? In addition, how do they influence the conceptual
      and theoretical developments in the field?"</p>
    <p>"The purpose of this article is to strengthen the process of theory
      construction or theorizing in the sense developed by Karl Weick"</p>
    <p>"We are proposing a designerly research approach that although being
      design oriented has the primary goal of supporting theorizing about
      interaction."</p>
    <p>"Many interaction design research approaches have as a primary goal to
      create a (concept) design that would support the use situation (Arrow 2).
      We are proposing an interaction research process that leads to concept
      designs and has as the primary goal supporting theoretical development
      (Arrow 1). Both these approaches are design oriented and both lead to
      designs, but the measure of success is radically different."</p>
