        <p>"Current research models do not provide useful ways of exploring co-adaptive phenomena, thus requiring new research models and methods. Research on<br/>technology and organizations commonly follows one of two theoretical models, each of which is inadequate to account for how users customize software. One treats technology as a static, independent variable, which influences the behavior of the people in the organization. The other treats the organization as the independent variable, in which decision-makers in an organization make strategic choices about technology and appropriate it for their own purposes. The structurational model proposed by Orlikowski (1989) takes both perspectives into account and incorporates an active role by individuals in the organization."</p>
        <p>"I propose changes in the software development process (to include observation of use in the field as an important input to future development), in software design (to include mechanisms that support reflection about use of the software and mechanisms for sharing of customizations), and for managers (to support periodic "maintenance" of skills and to support translators and help them provide more effective customizations for others in the organization)."</p>
