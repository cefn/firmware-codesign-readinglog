    <h2>Relevance</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;Links <em>design patterns</em> and <em>embedded systems</em>, but
      in the narrow case of <em>safety-critical systems</em>, and once again
      interastingly doesn't seem to take account of users, and has a
      non-functional requirements focus, quite explicitly, without considering
      any other focus (seemingly assuming that design patterns wouldn't apply).</p>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"Gross and Yu [12] discuss the relationship between non-functional
      requirements and design patterns,"</p>
    "This representation focuses on the implications and side effects of the
    represented design method on the non-functional requirements<br>
    of the safety-critical embedded system including safety, reliability,
    modifiability, cost and execution time."<br>
