        <h2>Relevance</h2>
        <p>Links<em>design patterns</em>and<em>embedded systems</em>, but in the narrow case of<em>safety-critical systems</em>, and once again interastingly doesn't seem to take account of users, and has a non-functional requirements focus, quite explicitly, without considering any other focus (seemingly assuming that design patterns wouldn't apply).</p>
        <h2>Quotations</h2>
        <p>"Gross and Yu [12] discuss the relationship between non-functional requirements and design patterns,"</p>
        <p>"This representation focuses on the implications and side effects of the represented design method on the non-functional requirements<br/>of the safety-critical embedded system including safety, reliability, modifiability, cost and execution time."<br/>
