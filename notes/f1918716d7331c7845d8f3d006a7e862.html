        <p>"We have explored a range of activities and tools that explicitly address these aspects in programming, with a specific focus on childrenâ€™s making of own computer games and simulations. We exemplify this work through three different situations where tools and activities are used by children as recourses for building of interactive systems, while at the same time allowing for bodily action in negotiation of design ideas. We discuss how situations like these may provide directions for new technologies for programming as well as methodological developments in the area of interaction design."</p>
