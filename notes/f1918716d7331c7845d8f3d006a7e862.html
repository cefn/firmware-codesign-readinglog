    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"We have explored a range of activities and tools that explicitly address
      these aspects in programming, with a specific focus on children’s making
      of own computer games and simulations. We exemplify this work through
      three different situations where tools and activities are used by children
      as recourses for building of interactive systems, while at the same time
      allowing for bodily action in negotiation of design ideas. We discuss how
      situations like these may provide directions for new technologies for
      programming as well as methodological developments in the area of
      interaction design."</p>
