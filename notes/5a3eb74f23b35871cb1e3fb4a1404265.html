      "This paper presents the Software Design Board, a prototype collaborative
      design tool supporting a variety of styles of collaboration, and
      facilitating transitions between them. The design of Software Design
      Board was motivated by empirical research demonstrating the<br/>
      importance of such support in collaborative software design"
    </p>
        <p>
      "To better support collaborative work, software design tools need to
      support a variety of workstyles for collaborative interaction, as well as
      support fluid transitions between these workstyles."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Particularly in the early stages of design, informal media...such as
      paper or whiteboards...are appropriate as they allow design diagrams to
      be quickly and fluidly sketched"
    </p>
        <p>
      "The main advantage of informal media tools is that they support a
      natural working style without imposing significant cognitive overhead on
      the user through heavyweight interaction mechanisms. They allow users to
      use the tool transparently, without having to think about the tool
      itself. The drawback of many of these tools is the limited, or
      non-existent, support for movement towards more formal, structured<br/>
      work. This lack of support may limit development as a design evolves and
      begins to require more formal treatment."

      "The first four dimensions of the model describe the nature of the
      collaboration in<br/>
      which a group is engaged, or that can be supported by a tool. They are
      defined as<br/>
      follows:<br/>
      • Location: The location axis refers to the distribution of the people
      involved in<br/>
      the collaboration. As people become more geographically
      distributed,<br/>
      supporting some collaborative workstyles becomes increasingly difficult
      [27].<br/>
      • Synchronicity: The synchronicity axis describes the temporal nature of
      the<br/>
      collaboration. People may work together at the same time (synchronously)
      or at<br/>
      different times (asynchronously).<br/>
      • Group Size: The group size axis captures the number of people involved
      in the<br/>
      collaboration. Support for larger groups typically comes at the expense
      of<br/>
      intimacy in the interaction between collaborators.<br/>
      • Coordination: This axis describes how users’ activities are
      coordinated,<br/>
      whether by the choice of tools they are using or through the adoption of
      some<br/>
      coordination model [22]."

      "Dimensions Describing Artifact Style<br/>
      The remaining four dimensions describe the nature of the artifacts
      produced by the<br/>
      group, or able to be produced by a tool. They are defined as
      follows:<br/>
      • Syntactic Correctness: The artifact being produced may be required to
      follow a<br/>
      precise syntax. This requirement may inhibit progress in early stages of
      design<br/>
      by forcing initially abstract designs to conform to a predetermined
      syntax [20,<br/>
      35].<br/>
      • Semantic Correctness: An artifact is considered to be semantically
      sound if its<br/>
      meaning is unambiguous and free of contradiction. The production of<br/>
      semantically sound artifacts facilitates automated analysis and
      evolution.<br/>
      • Archivability: Archivability represents the difficulty of saving an
      artifact so<br/>
      that it can be used at a later time. For example, word processing
      documents<br/>
      have high archivability, as they can be saved to disk and retrieved
      later.<br/>
      • Modifiability: This axis represents the ease with which an artifact can
      be<br/>
      modified. For example, small modifications"
