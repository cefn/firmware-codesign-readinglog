      "We propose a system for talking about experience, and look<br />
      at what influences experience and qualities of experience. The<br />
      framework is presented as a tool to understand what kinds of<br />
      experiences products evoke."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In this paper, we attempt<br />
      to provide an understanding of what user experience is and how<br />
      to design for one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Designers need<br />
      a clear idea of what experience is; what its components or ele-<br />
      ments are; and, perhaps more importantly, whether we can even<br />
      design or script experience, or simply be content to facilitate it
      or<br />
      keep from hindering it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<em>Experience as story</em><br />
      plays an important role in events as diverse as legal testimony and<br />
      fantasy gaming. Because experience as story is naturally commu-<br />
      nicative, it has relevance for sharing user findings with a design<br />
      team of various disciplines." [my italics]
