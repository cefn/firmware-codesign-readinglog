      Work from Lancaster University - a worthwhile thread to pick up with
      people still in faculty? Connects to the terms of an affordance as
      something which a specific user can avail themselves, rather than an
      objective or abstract feature of an object directly. Interestingly they
      extensively (3 times) reference Rachel Cooper who I studied with at
      Nottingham Philosophy department.

      "Drawing on ethnographic work on the ways technological artefacts engage,
      and are engaged by, disabled bodies, we propose that the ‘affordances’ of
      technological objects are not reducible to their material constitution
      but are inextricably bound up with specific, historically situated modes
      of engagement and ways of life."

      "Sociological studies of technological objects, it is claimed, are faced
      with an unpalatable choice between undersocialized and oversocialized
      conceptions of technology – represented by technological determinism and
      social constructivism respectively. This framing of the problem
      inevitably leads to a quest for a ‘third way’, a conception of technology
      that is neither over nor under- socialized but is – not unlike baby
      bear’s porridge – ‘just right’. For seekers of this third way, Gibson’s
      (1979) concept of ‘affordances’ has obvious attractions."

      "The ‘affordances’ of a post-box, however, exist only insofar as a
      particular letter- writing and mailing culture, knowledge, experience and
      so forth are actively maintained. The letter-mailing ‘affordance’ of the
      post-box is not something it possesses by virtue of its materiality but
      an ongoing – ‘sociomaterial’ (Barad, 1998) – accomplishment."

      "Aquarius, however, was designed for the moon landing and was not
      suitable for lengthy habitation. For instance, the carbon dioxide filters
      had a lifetime of about 40 person-hours, after which they had to be
      replaced. The Odyssey filters were square and would not fit the round
      sockets present onboard the Aquarius. The mission engineers had to
      somehow devise a way of plugging the square filters into the round
      sockets using only objects available on the spacecraft to accomplish this
      task."
