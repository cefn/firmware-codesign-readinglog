    <p>
      "the term’s use in HCI has been drawn from participatory design, an
      approach to the design of technology that calls for democratization and
      end-user involvement in the design process"
    </p>
    <p>
      "three of the main goals that have motivated user participation in design
      processes within HCI: sharing control, sharing expertise and inspiring
      change"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ehn [15,16] refers to how the setting of such workshops is typically
      situated around the formation of ‘boundary objects’ [49], which act<br />
      as shared articulations of knowledge of those participating in the design
      process. For example, Ehn discusses how participatory design workshops
      would involve the acting out of scenarios by workers with cardboard boxes
      that serve as imaginary computers"
