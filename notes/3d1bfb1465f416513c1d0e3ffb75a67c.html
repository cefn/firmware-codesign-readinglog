    <p>
      "Although they understood an exposition of the Pattern Language approach,
      even Final year students&#160;<br />
      found it difficult to generalise from examples, a high level cognitive
      skill. A two-stage process is&#160;<br />
      needed if generalisations are to be made, with individuals presenting
      examples from their own&#160;<br />
      experience from which can be identified. "
