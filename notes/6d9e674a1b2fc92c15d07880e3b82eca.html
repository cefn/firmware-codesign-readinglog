    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Chris Bull mentioned this as a good critique of UML. a/c Chris people say
      'what's the point', isn't it drawing on a piece of paper for the sake of
      it, but UML is for really large systems. But people who can code struggle
      with 're-representing it' in a picture form. [A meaningful transcendence
      of code, for architects ? Cefn] [Stubs and tests code-oriented way] </p>

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"Grossman et al... report “a wide diversity of opinion regarding UML”;
      for example, on one hand respondents did not find UML’s complexity an<br>
      impediment to its usage; on the other “Nearly, 62% of those surveyed
      agreed with the statement that UML is insufficiently specified which
      allows for misinterpretation.” (p. 387)</p>
    <p>"Dobing and Parsons [7] report ... that their respondents used a subset
      of the modelling notations available in UML 1.5: “Only Class Diagrams are
      being used regularly by over half the respondents, with Sequence and Use
      Case Diagrams used by about half.”...Collaboration / communication
      diagrams were the least popular. They also report disappointing effects of
      UML on communication, with 55% saying that UML was at best moderately
      successful in facilitating communication with clients."</p>
    <p>"[Nugroho and Chaudron...found] 29% of their respondents reported that
      problems of understandability of UML models led to problems in
      implementation ‘often’ or ‘very often’."</p>
    <p>"Lange et al ... identified four main classes of problems encountered:
      scattered information (e.g., design choices dependencies); incompleteness,
      disproportion (more detail for some parts than others),"</p>
    <p>"A survey ...by BZ Research [27] found that “In fact, only about
      one-third of developers recently surveyed said they use UML – and not a<br>
      single respondent believes that code generated from models is
      production-ready.” ...13 percent said that UML is too complex to learn."</p>
    <p>"The empirical study reported here is a series of interviews conducted
      over 2 years with more than 50 practicing professional software
      developers. Informants were identified with an eye to gathering a broad
      range of perspectives, from corporate large-scale commercial software
      developers to independent consultants, and across a variety of application
      areas." </p>
    <p>"The analysis was inductive...The categories, along with a representative
      selection of anonymized data, were presented to two experienced
      professional software developers for independent review, as a form of
      validation."</p>
    <p>"As one informant phrased it, and many others expressed: “What was good
      about UML was not new, and what was new about UML was not good.” "</p>
    <p>"One informant, who summarized that “UML does things we already had ways
      of doing. The notation doesn’t really matter”, also<br>
      set out a specific series of equivalences in his practice for elements of
      UML (e.g., “flowcharting, activity diagrams (I see<br>
      them as equivalent) – swim lanes have been around since the 1920s”, “ER
      diagrams (or class diagrams, roughly equivalent)”; “state diagrams – we’ve
      been expressing state machines for decades”; “the whole front of
      identifying context – a context diagram is rather better than trying to do
      anything with classes”) "</p>
    <p>"Two informants gave detailed accounts of past experiences of adopting
      UML on projects in response to client requests. However, those experiences
      were described as “disastrous”: the clients “...refused to sign it off,
      just too much detail, and they couldn’t make sense of it”. This was echoed
      by a third informant: “The best reason not to use UML is that it is not
      ‘readable’ for all stakeholders. How much is UML worth if a business user
      (the customer) can not understand the result of your modelling effort? He
      would be asked to sign off something that he isn’t able to comprehend...”</p>
    <p>"Several informants volunteered preferred alternatives. For example:
      “Object models... they’re not a compelling way of describing things. I
      prefer entity diagrams, which are a bit better.” Another argued: “There
      are a number of advantages of CoRE that are not available using UML....A
      third reported: “I’ve previously used SSADM, entity modeling, data flow
      diagramming, and I’m afraid I’ve reverted to using those rather than UML."</p>
