        <p>"In this paper we share our insights, based on several projects from research and many years of industrial practice, of conducting user studies with generative techniques."</p>
        <p>"The definition of context as ‘the environment of human-computer interaction’ indicates where context begins, but does not indicate where it ends. It just states it is what is outside the product. The term ‘context’ is a slippery notion. Context has many components besides time and space. We use the term context to refer to ‘all factors that influence the experience of a product use’."</p>
        <p>"A basic mechanism in generative techniques is to let people construct a view on the context, by calling up their memories of<br/>the past and by eliciting their dreams of the future."</p>
        <p>"Conventional user study techniques, such as interviews, observations and focus groups (Preece et al., 2002), uncover explicit and observable knowledge about contexts. The main limitation of conventional techniques, as far as designers of future products are concerned, is that they only offer a view on people’s current and past experiences, but provide little hold on the future. For learning about potential future experiences, we need to include peoples’ dreams and fears, their aspirations and ideas."</p>
        <p>"The basic principle behind generative techniques is to let people make designerly artefacts and then tell a story about what they have made. Examples of such artefacts are the collages on the table shown in figure 1 and the map shown in figure 7. The process of making artefacts such as drawings, collages and models, enables people to access and express their experiences. People reflect on, re-live and to some degree re-feel their experiences when they express themselves in these ways."</p>
        <p>"A contextmapping study typically involves a sequence of research steps including preparation, sensitizing participants, group sessions, analysis and communication"</p>
        <p>"Generative research appears less formal than more traditional forms of research but its successful application rests on carefully selecting the main directions of exploration"</p>
        <p>"Sensitizing is a process where participants are triggered, encouraged and motivated to think, reflect, wonder and explore aspects of their personal context in their own time and environment."</p>
