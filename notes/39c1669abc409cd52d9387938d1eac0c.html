      Credited elsewhere for the phrase "experts of their experiences" although
      it doesn't seem to actually be in the paper. Similar phrases appear,
      though.

      "In this paper we share our insights, based on several projects from
      research and many years of industrial practice, of conducting user
      studies with generative techniques."
    </p>
        <p>
      "The definition of context as ‘the environment of human-computer
      interaction’ indicates where context begins, but does not indicate where
      it ends. It just states it is what is outside the product. The term
      ‘context’ is a slippery notion. Context has many components besides time
      and space. We use the term context to refer to ‘all factors that
      influence the experience of a product use’."
    </p>
        <p>
      "A basic mechanism in generative techniques is to let people construct a
      view on the context, by calling up their memories of<br/>
      the past and by eliciting their dreams of the future."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Conventional user study techniques, such as interviews, observations and
      focus groups (Preece et al., 2002), uncover explicit and observable
      knowledge about contexts. The main limitation of conventional techniques,
      as far as designers of future products are concerned, is that they only
      offer a view on people’s current and past experiences, but provide little
      hold on the future. For learning about potential future experiences, we
      need to include peoples’ dreams and fears, their aspirations and ideas."
    </p>
        <p>
      "The basic principle behind generative techniques is to let people make
      designerly artefacts and then tell a story about what they have made.
      Examples of such artefacts are the collages on the table shown in figure
      1 and the map shown in figure 7. The process of making artefacts such as
      drawings, collages and models, enables people to access and express their
      experiences. People reflect on, re-live and to some degree re-feel their
      experiences when they express themselves in these ways."
    </p>
        <p>
      "A contextmapping study typically involves a sequence of research steps
      including preparation, sensitizing participants, group sessions, analysis
      and communication"
    </p>
        <p>
      "Generative research appears less formal than more traditional forms of
      research but its successful application rests on carefully selecting the
      main directions of exploration"
    </p>
        <p>
      "Sensitizing is a process where participants are triggered, encouraged
      and motivated to think, reflect, wonder and explore aspects of their
      personal context in their own time and environment."
