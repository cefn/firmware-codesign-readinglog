      "From our interviews, we found that often theoretical payoffs come after
      a project or design is finished, allowing for “reflection on a project
      with backward thinking.” Our goal taking this initial step towards
      defining design research and design theory for the design community is to
      begin a discussion of what design theory is and the role it can play in
      design research."
