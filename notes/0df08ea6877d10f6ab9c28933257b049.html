    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Try to arrive at a working definition of empathy for designers, drawing
      on psychology. They are interestingly doing the opposite of what I aim to
      do - enabling users to empathise with firmware designers! This is a very
      worthwhile contrasting design method, which is all about getting designers
      to understand the user's point of view, but does not engage users in
      design.</p>

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"The goal of this paper is to inform the discussion in the design
      community by applying the concept of empathy as it has developed in
      psychology. This paper presents a review of how empathy has been discussed
      in design and psychology literature, and proposes a background framework
      for supporting empathic approaches in designing."</p>
    <p>"Practitioners acknowledge the need to inform designers about user
      experiences and their context (Leonard and Rayport 1997, Buchenau and
      Fulton Suri 2000), and a number of tools and techniques have been
      presented (Fulton Suri 2003a) aiming to support designers to ‘step into
      the user’s shoes’ and ‘walk the user’s walk’ in order to design products
      that fit the user’s life"</p>
    <p>"Several authors describe a variety of tools and techniques that are
      regarded as particularly helpful for promoting empathy. We have divided
      these techniques into three main classes: techniques for direct contact
      between designers and users (research), techniques for communicating
      findings of user studies to design teams (communication) and techniques
      for evoking the designer’s own experiences in a domain relevant to the
      user (ideation)"</p>
