    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"This paper takes a critical look at using patterns and anti-patterns in
      teaching and debates the value of, and<br>
      possible pros and cons of using various forms of patterns and guidelines
      in teaching human-computer interaction (HCI)<br>
      concepts."</p>
    <p>"We report a survey of examples of teaching ‘about’ (teaching certain
      patterns themselves) and ‘with’ (using patterns as a means to teach a
      wider topic) patterns and anti-patterns in both software engineering (SE)
      and HCI, and the success or failure thereof."</p>
    <p>"Patterns are an approach to abstracting and capturing, for reuse,
      knowledge about what made a system, or paradigm,<br>
      successful. A pattern is a text that provides ‘a structured description of
      an invariant solution to a recurrent problem within<br>
      a context’" [attributed]</p>
    <p>"the term anti-pattern refers to a specific piece of negative advice or
      an example of bad practice, without explicitly associating any<br>
      details on how to correct (refactor) the problem."</p>
    <p>"An amelioration anti-pattern tells the reader how to go from a problem
      to a bad solution, but also how to get from that<br>
      bad solution to a good solution. It defines a migration (or refactoring)
      from negative solutions to positive solutions. It<br>
      tells you why the bad solution looks attractive, why it turns out to be
      bad in conjunction with the desired new outcome<br>
      or behaviour, and what positive patterns are applicable instead"</p>
    <p>"Interaction design patterns (HCI domain): a problem is stated in the
      domain of human interaction issues, and the<br>
      solution is stated in terms of suggested perceivable interaction behaviour
      [9]. Several collections of ID patterns exist,<br>
      e.g., the Tidwell’s collection [25], Sally Fincher’s Pattern Form Gallery
      [12] and Van Welie’s collection [28], Sari<br>
      Laakso’s collection [19], Coram and Lee’s Experiences [7], amongst
      others."</p>
