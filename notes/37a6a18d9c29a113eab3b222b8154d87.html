        support designers in getting hold of the immaterial material of software<br>
      </a></h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Reinforces my suspicion that there's something immaterial which designers
      and users find hard to express, and underlines my choice of firmware for
      non-OS devices, where that is exactly the design domain - the bit which
      cannot be sketched. However, in the case of this paper, they are still
      operating in a domain where the foil of 'UI design' masks the lack of
      actual software specification.</p>
    <p>They look at the design of novel controls, by conceiving challenges which
      exceed the scope of existing controls, focusing on imagined 'projected'
      controls - <em>Radio</em> station controls and volume on a bedspread, <em>Shower</em>
      (flow and temperature) and <em>Stove</em> (burner and temperature)
      examples.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Mentioned reframing (different context and social environment, for
      example) triggered different solutions. E.g. Team radio - a couple in bed
      using foot controls.</p>
    <p>They reference SILK and DENIM (which I used to use for sketching
      websites) in their commentary on sketching.</p>
    <p>They characterise static interfaces (before interaction) as described by
      affordance and feedforward, with expression and feedback being interactive
      aspects. </p>
    After running a design workshop, they ran a 'meta-design' workshop to try
    and understand what possible tools could be used to explore and communicate
    possible design choices.<br>
    <br>
    They characterise issues with designers' appreciation of the development
    problem, and downstream transfer of knowledge, which mirrors my claims about
    users.<br>

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"When designing novel GUI controls, interaction designers are challenged
      by the “immaterial” materiality of the digital domain; they lack tools
      that effectively support a reflecting conversation with the material of
      software as they attempt to conceive, refine, and communicate their ideas.
      To investigate this situation, we conducted two participatory design
      workshops."</p>
    <p>"Through a creative process of ideation (sketching) and iteration
      (prototyping), designers engage in a “conversation with materials” [29,
      30], striving to find harmonious intersections between what is possible,
      acceptable, needed, and desired. As designers conceive of a new idea or
      refine the details of an existing idea, the materials they use begin to
      “talk back”, revealing new opportunities and challenges. For example, when
      sketching with a pencil on paper, designers can explore a product’s
      physical form, reacting as each line is added to the page."</p>
    <p>"designers cannot easily play with the material of software, making
      development of tacit knowledge much more difficult...many interaction
      designers lack the competency to effectively implement their ideas in
      software in order to critique them [28], significantly limiting reflection
      on action. Instead, designers often find themselves handing off static,
      annotated, screen designs"</p>
    <p>"Blueprints have evolved over time into a conventional form that has
      become embedded in the practice of architecture; however, such detailed,
      conventional artifacts do not yet exist for software<br>
      development."</p>
    <p>"Framing the output as a boundary object allows the developer to become
      the voice of the software, allowing the conversation with material to also
      include the transfer of the concept from design to development; making the
      transfer a co-creative endeavor."</p>
    <p>"designers (non-developers) lack the fluency with development tools to
      effectively sketch with the material of software."</p>
    <p>"designers have difficulty describing their desired interactive behaviors
      to developers who will implement these behaviors [7, 21, 22], and we
      suspect this is because they do not know what it is they want, since they
      have not had enough opportunity for reflection, especially on the small
      details of the interactive behaviors"</p>
    <p>"we asked both designer and developer to design a communicative artifact
      that designers could deliver to developers that would best capture the
      needs of the developers to make the artifact and the needs of the
      designers to effectively capture their vision. In the end, we asked all of
      the groups to share their designs."</p>
    <p>"3. Movies that capture the underlying user scenarios and that also
      document the dynamic changes in the interface were<br>
      seen as the most effective technique for communicating a refined design."</p>
    <p>"one team suggested that a new tool would allow the development team to
      define boundaries on the supported interactive behaviors and their
      interrelations before designers began to conceive of ideas. This would
      help guide the designer in producing something with the aesthetic quality
      they desired, but that could also be built"</p>
    <p>"Based on their ease of working and success at generating ideas, we are
      not at all confident that they should use electronic tools at this point
      in the process; tools that tend to focus their attention on a screen and
      away from the felt-life experience of being the user in context."</p>
    <p>"designers’ draw inspiration from the user context, channeling the user
      to continually engage in a scenario-based design approach"</p>
    <p>"We feel the process of transferring a design from designers to
      developers would be significantly improved by recasting the output of the
      design process from a specification of what specifically should be built,
      to a boundary object that allows designers and developers to engage in an
      effective conversation as to what is desirable, probable, and possible."</p>
    "we propose three aspects we feel would be needed to make the tool’s output
    work effectively as a boundary object between developers and
    designers....First...it should include animations and interactive
    simulations demonstrating the main usage scenarios...Second...links<br>
    to the supporting examples, such as videos showing motion...images used to
    support the final visual design...Third...it should allow for easy export of
    visual elements and code to aid with transfer...The boundary object should
    function socially with both developers and designers, and it should work in
    isolation. In both cases, users should be able to annotate it with
    questions, concerns about conflicts and dependencies, and design suggestions"<br>
    <br>
    "designers rough out ideas (reflecting in action) and then critique what
    they have done (reflecting on action) in order to conceive of and refine a
    new idea. Today most interaction designers transfer their design concepts to
    developers using, static, annotated screens. These transfers are often less
    than ideal, as the designer has not had enough feedback to know if this is
    the design they want"<br>
