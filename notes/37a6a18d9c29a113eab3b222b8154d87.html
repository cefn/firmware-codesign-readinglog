        support designers in getting hold of the immaterial material of software<br>
      </a></h1>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Reinforces my suspicion that there's something immaterial which designers
      and users find hard to express, and underlines my choice of firmware for
      non-OS devices, where that is exactly the design domain - the bit which
      cannot be sketched. However, in the case of this paper, they are still
      operating in a domain where the foil of 'UI design' masks the lack of
      actual software specification.</p>
    <p>They look at the design of novel controls, by conceiving challenges which
      exceed the scope of existing controls, focusing on imagined 'projected'
      controls - <em>Radio</em> station controls and volume on a bedspread, <em>Shower</em>
      (flow and temperature) and <em>Stove</em> (burner and temperature)
      examples.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Mentioned reframing (different context and social environment, for
      example) triggered different solutions. E.g. Team radio - a couple in bed
      using foot controls.</p>

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"When designing novel GUI controls, interaction designers are challenged
      by the “immaterial” materiality of the digital domain; they lack tools
      that effectively support a reflecting conversation with the material of
      software as they attempt to conceive, refine, and communicate their ideas.
      To investigate this situation, we conducted two participatory design
      workshops."</p>
    <p>"Through a creative process of ideation (sketching) and iteration
      (prototyping), designers engage in a “conversation with materials” [29,
      30], striving to find harmonious intersections between what is possible,
      acceptable, needed, and desired. As designers conceive of a new idea or
      refine the details of an existing idea, the materials they use begin to
      “talk back”, revealing new opportunities and challenges. For example, when
      sketching with a pencil on paper, designers can explore a product’s
      physical form, reacting as each line is added to the page."</p>
    <p>"designers cannot easily play with the material of software, making
      development of tacit knowledge much more difficult...many interaction
      designers lack the competency to effectively implement their ideas in
      software in order to critique them [28], significantly limiting reflection
      on action. Instead, designers often find themselves handing off static,
      annotated, screen designs"</p>
    <p>"Blueprints have evolved over time into a conventional form that has
      become embedded in the practice of architecture; however, such detailed,
      conventional artifacts do not yet exist for software<br>
      development."</p>
    <p>"Framing the output as a boundary object allows the developer to become
      the voice of the software,<br>
      allowing the conversation with material to also include the transfer of
      the concept from design to development; making the transfer a co-creative
      endeavor."</p>
