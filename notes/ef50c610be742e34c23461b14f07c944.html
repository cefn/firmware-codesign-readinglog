        <p>"Practice is bounded in a specific material, historical and social context that shapes what agents do and gives meaning to habitual actions (Suchman 1987; Lave 1988). This view allows us to see where boundaries in practice come from. As agents engage in practice, they develop a continuity in their local practices, which allows them to act knowledgeably in a given context but also distinguishes them from others who do not engage in this practice or engage in it only peripherally (Wenger 1998: 103). Practice theorists have conceptualized this phenomenon as the emergence of fields (Bourdieu and Wacquant 1992: 96-120) 1 . By engaging in fields, agents pursue a joint interest (an inclination and ability to succeed in a given endeavor), but also differentiate themselves from outsiders who do not pursue the same interest. At any given time, agents are engaged in multiple, nested fields."</p>
        <p>"Through their engagement in fields, agents produce different kinds of resources (capital) that they can accumulate and use as bases of power in a field. Bourdieu distinguishes four key species of capital: economic capital (e.g., money, time, IT), cultural capital (e.g., professional expertise, education, ownership of information), and social capital (which social networks an agent can draw on); in addition, symbolic capital is defined as the ability to name any other resource as valuable—the power to name and classify things"</p>
        <p>"the emergence of a boundary spanning competence in practice is associated with the emergence of a new joint field which unites agents in pursuit of a common organizational interest, but also distinguishes them from others who are not engaged in such pursuit" [by designing firmware workshops and blueprints are we trying to create a joint field?]</p>
        <p>"What is missing is an understanding of how the aspirations behind “boundary spanning mechanisms” become or do not become enacted in practice."</p>
        <p>"For example, the boundary spanner’s roles have been distinguished into representative vs. gatekeeper, advice vs. trust broker (Friedman and Podolny 1992) as well as scout, ambassador, sentry, and guard (Ancona and Caldwell 1992)."</p>
        <p>"Examples of boundary objects include physical prototypes (Carlile 2002; Bechky 2003), design drawings (Bødker 1998), use scenarios (Bødker 2000), engineering sketches (Henderson 1991; Bechky 1999), accounting ledgers (Briers and Chua 2001), and standardized reporting forms (Star and Griesemer 1989; Bowker and Star 1994; Bowker et al. 1996; Briers and Chua 2001). The term “boundary object” thus refers to a broad range of artifacts that “are plastic enough to adapt to local needs and constraints of the several parties employing them, yet robust enough to maintain a common identity across sites” (Star 1989: 393)."</p>
