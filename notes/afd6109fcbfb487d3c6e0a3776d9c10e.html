        <p>"Sketching, or the production of untidy im-<br/>ages to assist in the development of visual ideas, is one of the<br/>oldest and most familiar activities of artists and designers."</p>
        <p>"Typically, visual design starts with a number of vague,<br/>half-formed ideas. Sketching is conducted both to clarify<br/>existing ideas and to develop new ones. In the early stages,<br/>the artist may wish to preserve many visual options, restrict-<br/>ing his or her imagery to global structures, or using notes<br/>and signs that implicate multiple alternatives. Paper sketch-<br/>ing uses denotation systems that include tolerances and<br/>indeterminacies in ways that can amplify the artist's ability<br/>to perceive or imagine many options."</p>
        <p>"How do scribbled lines or<br/>washes of colour support and<br/>stimulate visual invention?<br/>What inferences can be made<br/>about the cognitive processes and representations with<br/>which they are interacting?"</p>
        <p>"The necessity to sketch arises from the need to foresee the<br/>results of the synthesis or manipulation of objects without<br/>actually executing such operations."</p>
