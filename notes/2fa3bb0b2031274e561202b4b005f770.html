      "We often find the term ‘practice’ being assumed to be synonymous with
      ‘routine’, or taken to be a generic equivalent of<br />
      ‘what people really do’, without addressing the link between practice and
      knowledge,<br />
      its original and distinctive critique of the modernist conceptions of
      knowledge<br />
      (i.e. practice as the generative source of knowledge), and the
      methodological<br />
      problems that its use implies."
