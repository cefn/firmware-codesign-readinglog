    <p>"Designers, during a conceptual design process, do not just synthesize<br>
      solutions that satisfy initially given requirements, but also invent
      design<br>
      issues or requirements that capture important aspects of the given<br>
      problem. How do they do this?...attending to visuo-spatial features in
      sketches<br>
      which were not intended when they were drawn, are believed to<br>
      contribute to it."</p>
