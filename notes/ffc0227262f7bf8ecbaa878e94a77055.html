        </h1>
        <h2>Authors</h2>
        <p>Ernesto G. Arias and Gerhard Fischer</p>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>They describe specifically the issues of boundary objects for users to program computers, contrasting the situation view adopted by users and the system view which must be adopted to program them. They mention Domain Oriented Design Environments (referencing Fischer). Important to read.<br/>

        <h2>Quotations</h2>
        <p>"When users approach a problem, they often begin at a high level of abstraction, conceptualizing the design in terms of the application problem to be solved [Curtis et al., 1988]. This initial conceptualization must then be translated into terms that the computer can understand."</p>
        <p>"One such challenge is to integrate the various perspectives<br/>emerging from the symmetry of ignorance among articulate<br/>stakeholders. By supporting the process of reflection within<br/>a shared context defined by the task at hand, opportunities<br/>can emerge from enhancing the creation of shared<br/>understanding."</p>
