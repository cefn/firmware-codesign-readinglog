        <p>"Designers have been moving increasingly closer to the future users of what they design and the next new thing in the changing landscape of design research has become co-designing with your users."</p>
        <p>"The first advances, well consolidated now in industrial practice and education, practiced user-centred design from an ‘expert perspective’ in which trained researchers observe and/or interview largely passive users, whose contribution is to perform instructed tasks and/or to give their opinions about product concepts that were generated by others."</p>
        <p>"By co-design we indicate collective creativity as it is applied across the whole span of a design process"</p>
        <p>"The application of participatory design practices (both at the moment of idea generation and continuing throughout the design process at all key moments of decision) to very large-scale problems will change design and may change the world."</p>
        <p>"Users can become part of the design team as ‘expert of their experiences’ (Sleeswijk Visser et al. 2005), but in order for them to take on this role, they must be given appropriate tools for expressing themselves"</p>
        <p>"As researchers we will need to learn how to:<br/>.<strong>lead</strong>people who are on the ‘doing’ level of creativity,<br/>.<strong>guide</strong>those who are at the ‘adapting’ level,<br/>.<strong>provide scaﬀolds</strong>that support and serve peoples’ need for creative expression at the<br/>‘making’ level, and<br/>.<strong>oﬀer a clean slate</strong>for those at the ‘creating’ level"<br/>
            <br/>"In addition to bringing people into the design process in the ways most conducive to their ability to participate, researchers will need to bring in applicable domain theories in a way that can be handled by the co-design team"<br/>
