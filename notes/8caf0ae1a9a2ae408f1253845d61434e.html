    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Author on knowledge transfer, boundaries, recommended by Patrick. The
      scenario I'm looking at is very much simpler than their "Beta motors"
      example - just users and firmware engineers. They emphasise the relevance
      of knowledge transfer in the early phases of product design, and firmware
      co-design is almost completely the opposite end of this - the product is
      mostly settled. Their case concerns complex interdependencies amongst
      multiple specialist groups. Core concepts are "difference and dependence."
      meaning the separation of different specialists, as well as their need to
      get along, or resolve things together. On this analysis, users and
      engineers max out both dimensions.</p>
    <p>He discusses the use of a 'clay model' (carving of a car?) as a kind of
      boundary object, or in his terms a kind of 'knowledge' which failed in
      certain ways to accommodate new conflicts and transfers between teams with
      different function in delivering a new car design. He evolves the term
      boundary object to consider "boundary processes" and "boundary
      infrastructure"</p>

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    "The framework describes three progressively complex types of boundaries—
    syntactic, semantic and pragmatic—each managed by a different
    process—transfer, translation and transformation."
    <p>"Each increasingly complex boundary requires a more complex process to
      facilitate communication and innovation across specialized forms of
      knowledge."</p>
    <p>"From a knowledge perspective, differences at a boundary arise from
      variation in the type of skills and backgrounds or amount of experience
      between individuals or groups."</p>
    <p>"When a shared syntax or language sufficiently specifies the differences
      and dependencies at the boundary the boundary is “unproblematic;” the
      primary concern becomes “processing” or transferring knowledge through
      this shared syntax."</p>
    <p>"successful movements of knowledge occur when the parties are specialized
      in the same type of activity, so the primary difference is only that the
      sender is experienced in the best practice and the receiver is not."</p>
    <p>"The value of a syntactical approach to managing knowledge across a
      boundary is realized when a shared and stable syntax/language exists.
      Based on this knowledge can be efficiently transferred at the boundary.
      Such a shared and stable syntax/language is constructed from previous
      efforts at a boundary to address the critical differences and dependencies
      between the two groups—and once established only the costs of transferring
      knowledge are faced at the boundary."</p>
    "Under these conditions a shared and sufficient syntax that had been used in
    the past is no longer able to address the novel differences and dependencies
    which arise. So, while a shared syntax is necessary, it is not always
    sufficient to address all conditions at a boundary."<br>
    <br>
    "A semantic approach to crossing a boundary recognizes that problems of
    interpretation exist because the contexts in which people develop their
    knowledge are different or as novelty increases, interpretive or semantic
    differences as to what a word, measurement or outcome means arise at a
    boundary."<br>
    <br>
    "Frequently highlighted in the community of practice literature is the role
    of “stories” as an effective means of sharing knowledge and meaning (Wenger,
    1998). In Orr’s (1996) study of Xerox repairman, “war stories” proved an
    effective tool in sharing knowledge about the complex technical and social
    situations that arise when repairing a copier."<br>
    <br>
    "When moving knowledge across [a] boundary often the problem is one of
    different interests, not just different meanings that need to be
    reconciled."<br>
    <br>
    "To understand the problematic nature of knowledge, it must be understood as
    localized, embedded and invested in the tasks, methods and outcomes of a
    specific practice (i.e., knowledge-in-practice). Knowledge is costly to
    develop (i.e., education, training, experience) and to change, so it should
    be seen as “at stake” for the individuals in a given practice (Bourdieu and
    Wacquant, 1992). This helps us see more clearly why accommodating the
    knowledge of another group is not a neutral or costless effort. The cost for
    any group dealing with increasing novelty at a boundary is not just the cost
    of learning about what is new. It is also the costs of adjusting or
    transforming their “current” ways of doing things to accommodate the
    knowledge developed by another group to collaborate at a boundary."<br>
    <br>
    "a complex boundary process has to be developed where current and more novel
    forms of knowledge can be represented, learned about, and then jointly
    transformed"<br>
    <br>
    "the clay model’s representational capacity to support such a pragmatic
    process was undermined as the conditions at the boundary became increasingly
    novel during the 80’s and early 90’s The clay model could no longer
    represent the differences and dependencies that were relevant across the
    four groups involved as it did not provide a means for them to collectively
    make trade-offs and transform their current knowledge."<br>
    <br>
    "I have identified three following characteristics...that we might expect to
    see in an effective boundary process: establishes a shared language to
    represent knowledge; provides a concrete means of specifying differences and
    dependencies; and facilitates a method in which individuals can jointly
    transform the knowledge used"<br>
    <br>
    "A climate control engineer summed this up nicely, when he said, “we
    disagree sooner and know what we are disagreeing about more productively
    when we have a shared basis to compare our requirements.”<br>
    <br>
    "The first characteristic required to effectively manage knowledge across a
    pragmatic boundary is the development of some shared language or syntax to
    represent knowledge at the boundary...The second characteristic required to
    manage knowledge across a pragmatic boundary is that the individuals
    involved need the ability to represent their preferences to others...The
    third characteristic required to manage knowledge across a pragmatic
    boundary is that the process or tool can be used to alter or transform the
    knowledge being used at the boundary."<br>
    <br>
    "the ability and willingness of individuals to change their knowledge or
    position only emerges when a process of identifying how it negatively
    impacts others is established"<br>
    <br>
    "The gap at many boundaries cannot be resolved with one try, but requires an
    iterative process of closing the gap—experimenting and shaping alternatives
    and solutions overtime....<br>
