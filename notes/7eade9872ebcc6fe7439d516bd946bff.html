        Study of Forces and Frictions affecting Large-Scale Model-Driven
        Development</a></h1>
    <h2>Authors</h2>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Linked to UBC - a very interesting location in the world for paragliding
      :) </p>
    <p>They look into cognitive issues of using model-driven approach in
      software engineering for cars (firmware) drawing on interviews and using
      the metaphor of force and friction, in a way which is intended to
      transcend the specific tools used, and apply to model-driven in general.</p>
    These forces and frictions, and the form of analysis used, may transfer to
    the study of (representational) boundary objects for firmware engineering. <br>
    <br>
    Also interesting are the (multi-layered) representations inside Simulink,
    and the other representations, including formal transformation rules, and
    informal 'patches' which accrete around it.<br>
    <br>
    Deserves a proper read-through, having just cherry-picked the important
    concepts this time, especially to decide whether these 'forces and
    frictions' transfer to firmware co-design.<br>

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"Most domain experts thus have a strong background in electrical or
      mechanical engineering, but typically no formal education in software
      engineering."</p>
    <p>"Fig. 2. Sketch of a Simulink model: from left to right we see model
      layers of increasing nesting level, starting with the entry function down
      to implementation logic." [links to layers within Service blueprinting?]</p>
    <p>"Using Brooks’s terminology, forces are indicators of innate complexity
      while frictions introduce accidental complexity"</p>
    <p>"Without the linear order of text lines, which is superimposed upon
      source code, visual programming as found in models has no linear reading
      path and can possibly stretch in all directions, left, right, top, bottom,
      and even down to the next nesting level. While modeling guidelines try to
      alleviate this by imposing a flow from top-left to bottom-right, engineers
      struggle with reading visual models as to make sure they are not missing a
      part of their work to-be-done."</p>
    <p>"While architectural complexity is well hidden from software engineers,
      they are still exposed to substantial innate complexity (contextual
      forces) and often even new accidental complexity (points of frictions in
      modeling tools). In particular, the representational abstraction of visual
      modeling languages does not seem to be as broad and rich as the
      problem-specific visual and formal languages of the domain experts."</p>
    <p>"While the MDE tools under study provide specialized code-generation
      engineers with powerful abstraction, they do not similarly empower its
      end-users, i.e., domain experts and software engineers, to express their
      own problem-specific languages and type systems."</p>
