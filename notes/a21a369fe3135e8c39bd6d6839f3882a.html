    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"when we speak about “qualitative”<br>
      research, we mean social research in which the<br>
      researcher relies on text data rather than numerical data,<br>
      analyzes those data in their textual form rather than<br>
      converting them to numbers for analysis, aims to under-<br>
      stand the meaning of human action (Schwandt, 2001)"</p>
    <p>"Method, methodology, and epistemology are defined in conflicting ways in
      the research literature. For the purposes of this article, we will define
      them as follows. Epistemology is “the study of the nature of knowledge and
      justification” (Schwandt, 2001, p. 71), and epistemological issues are
      “issues about an adequate theory of knowledge or justificatory strategy”
      (Harding, 1987, p. 2). As shorthand, epistemology can be thought of as
      justification of knowledge. A methodology is defined as “a theory and
      analysis of how research should proceed” (Harding, 1987, p. 2), “analysis
      of the assumptions, principles, and procedures in a particular approach to
      inquiry” (Schwandt, 2001, p. 161), or “the study—the description, the
      explanation, and the justification—of methods, and not the methods
      themselves” (Kaplan, 1964, p. 18). In short, methodology provides
      justification for the methods of a research project. Methods are
      “techniques for gathering evidence” (Harding, 1987, p. 2) or “procedures,
      tools and techniques” of research (Schwandt, 2001, p. 158). Methods can be
      thought of as research action. In the simplest terms, methodology
      justifies method, which produces data and analyses. Knowledge is created
      from data and analyses. Epistemology modifies methodology and justifies
      the knowledge produced"</p>
    <p>"Accordingly, we will discuss epistemic questions, questions regarding
      research practice as knowledge creation and the status of the knowledge
      created, as academic researchers informed by the qualitative research
      literature."</p>
