      Great and relevant references ended up interfering with my end-to-end
      reading of this PhD. Well worth a proper read.

      "The concept of boundary objects comes from the social studies of
      science. Researchers in<br />
      this field have found that heterogeneous scientific communities routinely
      employ<br />
      boundary objects in their collaborative problem solving (Star, 1989; Star
      and Griesemer,<br />
      1989). Boundary objects have also been found to be useful in engineering
      product<br />
      development (Bechky, 1999; Carlile, 1997; Henderson, 1991) and medical
      classification<br />
      systems (Bowker and Star, 1994; Bowker, et al., 1996). In the IS
      literature, Boland and<br />
      Tenkasi (1995) suggest that while narratives play a critical role in
      creating knowledge<br />
      6within professional communities, boundary objects are critical for
      sharing knowledge<br />
      across communities. Boundary objects have been found to be effective in
      combating<br />
      knowledge sharing challenges because they made the contextual and tacit
      character of an<br />
      individual’s knowledge more accessible and visible (Carlile, 1997). They
      have also been<br />
      seen to function as power tokens by enlarging knowledge boundaries
      between functions<br />
      and creating a common investment (Carlile, 1997)."

    <p>
      "Prior<br />
      literature suggests that the following specific questions should be
      useful...
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>What is the nature of the social boundaries in and across
      organizations?
      </li>
      <li>Which communicative genres emerge in multi-party IS development
      settings?
      </li>
      <li>How do communicative genres evolve over the lifetime of an IS
      project?
      </li>
      <li>What role do boundary objects play in cross-boundary communicative
      genres on<br />
        IS projects?
      </li>
      <li>Which communicative genres are effective in increasing the quality of
      IS project<br />
        outcomes?" [This last question is very strongly linked to the previous]
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      "tangibility, “the ability to hold and manipulate an object,” is a key
      characteristic of boundary objects (Carlile, 1997)"
