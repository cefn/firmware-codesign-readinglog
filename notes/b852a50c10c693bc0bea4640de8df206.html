        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>Only tangentially relevant, but expands on the notion of ephemeralisation (a theme discussed by Shaffer when discussing the general screen-based computer - ephemeralised - versus domain-specific devices with buttons etc.). A nice "activity theory" quotation about design space though.</p>

        <p>"New technologies increase the number of options to be considered and the amount of information that needs to be assimilated. The broader and more powerful the technology, the larger the increase. The required effort to study these new data with its accompanying stress (e.g. in the form of the information fatigue syndrome mentioned above) will obviously reduce the productivity of employees, and increase the probability of errors and ineffectual use."</p>
        <p>"To find the most productive use of a new technology, avoiding all unexpectedly negative side-effects, you should systematically study all possible options and all their direct and indirect consequences. Because of bounded rationality, however, this is obviously impossible. Instead, improvements are typically made by trial-and-error, where first the most obvious applications are tried out, and users slowly become aware of their positive and negative effects. On the basis of that experience, they learn how to avoid clearly unproductive applications. They then try out minor variations or improvements on the apparent “best practices”, and perhaps carry out a few more daring experiments that may open wholly new domains of application. They thus gradually discover more productive ways to use this same technology, ending up with initially unimagined uses."</p>
