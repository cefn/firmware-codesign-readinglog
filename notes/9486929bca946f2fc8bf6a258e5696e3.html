      "Existing design frameworks and methodologies for software development
      [Boehm &amp; Turner, 2004; Gamma et al., 1995; Ingalls et al., 1997],
      focusing primarily on productivity-driven systems, are insufficient to
      cope with the need for situated or even unintended uses created by the
      increasing involvement of domain experts participating as “owners of
      problems” who can contribute unique expertise to a complex design
      problem. A new class of participative and creativity-driven software
      systems is needed (see Section 3.1). The development of such systems
      cannot be completely delegated to professional software developers
      because new requirements, which are unimaginable even to the users
      themselves before using the system, continuously pop up. This requires
      frameworks and systems focused on continual development,
      reflection-in-action, and user communities (see Section 3.3)."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As software systems are being increasingly woven into daily lives and
      reshape the way people interact, collaborate, work, and think,
      requirements for software systems have become more individually
      differentiated and continuously change during their ongoing use. This
      research will create the scientific foundation for the design of
      participative software systems that do not have fixed requirements at any
      point in time, and necessitate user participation and contribution as a
      fundamental part of the system."
