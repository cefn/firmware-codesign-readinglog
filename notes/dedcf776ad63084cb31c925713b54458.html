        <p>"Giddens gives us a theoretical vocabulary that tries to capture the relationship<br/>between social systems and the actors who make them up...Structure, Giddens says, is what gives form<br/>and shape to social life, without itself being that form and shape...By this he means that social structure is a set of rules analogous<br/>to the paradigmatic structure of language, the ‘virtual structure of significance’ which provides the underlying grid from which actual speech is<br/>generated. 1 The paradigmatic structure gives form and shape to a language<br/>but is only partially visible through particular instances of speech or writing."</p>
