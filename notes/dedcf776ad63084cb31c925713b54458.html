      "Giddens gives us a theoretical vocabulary that tries to capture the
      relationship<br />
      between social systems and the actors who make them up...Structure,
      Giddens says, is what gives form<br />
      and shape to social life, without itself being that form and shape...By
      this he means that social structure is a set of rules analogous<br />
      to the paradigmatic structure of language, the ‘virtual structure of
      significance’ which provides the underlying grid from which actual speech
      is<br />
      generated. 1 The paradigmatic structure gives form and shape to a
      language<br />
      but is only partially visible through particular instances of speech or
      writing."
