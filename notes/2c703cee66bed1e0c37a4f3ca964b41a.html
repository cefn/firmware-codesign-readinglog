      Inspiring use of prototyping elements like Phidgets and rapid development
      approaches for 'experience prototyping'. Read when you need cheering up.

      "Buchenau and Fulton give an operational definition of an experience
      prototype as<br/>
      “...any kind of representation, in any medium, that is designed to
      understand, explore<br/>
      or communicate what it might be like to engage with the product, space or
      system we<br/>
      are designing” (Buchenau &amp; Fulton, 2000). The focus is “the
      experiential aspect of<br/>
      whatever representations are needed to successfully (re)live or convey an
      experience<br/>
      with a product, space or system” (ibid.)"
    </p>
        <p>
      "To build experiential prototypes for these types of concepts one
      must<br/>
      make a technology shift from easily programmable, familiar, personal
      computer<br/>
      platforms to the more difficult class of embedded platforms. This takes
      the designer out<br/>
      of the loop and involves engineers with a consequential loss of designer
      influence."
    </p>
        <p>
      "When involving interactive technology in the design process it is
      important that it is<br/>
      ready-at-hand 1 for the designers to use. Designers should be able to
      work with<br/>
      sensors, actuators and simulated product functionality in a sketchy
      manner (Buxton,<br/>
      2007). They make many 3D sketches to study the complex
      interdependent<br/>
      relationships between products, users and context. This is made possible
      by using<br/>
      high-level programming tools and modular sensor systems (Hummels,
      Overbeeke, &amp;<br/>
      Klooster, 2007). In this way design iteration can be performed quickly
      steering clear of<br/>
      complex and time consuming engineering work."
