        <p>Presents a model of undertaking and reporting design projects within information systems which is intended to be defensible for publishing.</p>
        <h2>Quotations</h2>
        <p>"The process includes six steps: problem identification and motivation, objectives for a<br/>solution, design and development, evaluation, and communication."</p>
        <p>"Information systems (IS) is an “applied” research discipline, we acknowledge, in the sense that we apply theory, frequently from other disciplines, such as economics, computer science, and the social sciences, to solve problems at the intersection of IT and organizations. Yet the dominant research paradigms we use to produce and publish research for our most respected research outlets largely continue to be traditional descriptive research borrowed from the social and natural sciences."</p>
        <p>"Engineering disciplines accept design as a valid and valuable research methodology, but for the most part, major IS journals still seem to find it a questionable model for quality research."</p>
