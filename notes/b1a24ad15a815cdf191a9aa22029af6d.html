      They explore the definition of the term feedforward as a means of
      exploring interaction design opportunities for using it.<br/>

        <p>
      "Bellotti et al. [2] argue that, unlike designers of GUI interfaces,
      designers of “sensing systems” – which include context-aware systems,
      gestural interfaces, tangible interaction and post-WIMP user interfaces
      [26] in general – have few pre-packaged answers available to solve basic
      interaction design challenges."
    </p>
        <p>
      "this paper focuses on the usage of the term feedforward in the context
      of interaction design. The first definition of feedforward in this
      context was given by Djajadiningrat et al"
    </p>
        <p>
      "Feedback bridges Norman’s Gulf of Evaluation [22] – the amount of effort
      users must exert to interpret the state of the system and to determine
      how well the expectations and intentions have been met – by helping users
      evaluate the state of the system."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Perceived affordances are also used for bridging Norman’s Gulf of
      Execution, but serve a different purpose: they suggest a particular
      action to users, such as pressing a button, or turning a knob."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Context-aware systems [5] typically act based on implicit input
      collected from the environment. Additionally, system actions are usually
      a result of complex reasoning about context data which might be hard for
      users to understand and makes the system unpredictable [3]."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Feedback is one of the most well-known design principles in interaction
      design, along with affordances, visibility, constraints and mappings"
    </p>
        <p>
      "perceived affordances (affordances that the user is made aware of
      through good design) essentially invite the user to a particular action.
      Affordances therefore “suggest” how one can interact with a product or
      system. Typical examples in HCI are buttons which “afford” pushing, knobs
      which “afford” turning, or sliders which “afford” moving up and down (or
      left and right, depending on the orientation). Affording the right
      actions has been widely regarded as a crucial aspect of usability."
    </p>
        <p>
      "[Gaver] describes two different relationships between affordances:
      nesting and sequence. Nested affordances are grouped in space, while
      sequential affordances are sequential in time (i.e., acting on an
      affordance leads to information indicating new affordances)."
    </p>
        <p>
      "sequential affordances ...[are] common in graphical user interfaces
      since these can be updated during usage. In contrast, physical objects
      usually have a static physical appearance and cannot update their form
      over time."
    </p>
        <p>
      "four types of affordances are tightly coupled and work together to help
      users in their interaction. Physical affordances are associated with the
      “operability” characteristics of user interface artefacts. Cognitive
      affordances are associated with the semantics or meaning of user
      interface artefacts. Sensory affordances have a supporting role, and are
      associated with the “sense-ability” characteristics of user in-<br/>
      terface artefacts, especially of physical affordances and cognitive
      affordances" [credited to Hartson]
    </p>
        <p>
      "Norman provides two ways to help users determine the purpose of a user
      interface artefact: mappings and a good conceptual model"
    </p>
        <p>
      [Hartson's] "cognitive affordances...are key to answering Norman’s
      question:“How do you know what to do?”.
    </p>
        <p>
      "Gaver introduces the concept of false and hidden affordances, where the
      apparent information about the affordance is incorrect or missing
      respectively"
