        Usability and User Experience Information from Online User Reviews</a></h1>
    <h2>Authors</h2>
    <p>Steffen Hedegaard, Jakob Grue Simonsen</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Dimensions (satisfaction measures) of interactive products discussed.
      Should bottom this out. Need a source of critical design in the context of
      firmware. This is close - in the context of software/video games, but uses
      an interesting technique - harvesting from online reviews (similar to
      source based on bike light review).</p>
    <p>They adopt textual analysis of online reviews as a basis for figuring out
      how much information content online-reviews might provide for UX and
      usability feedback. This is linked to sentiment analysis but (they claim)
      is a much more focused science on UX.</p>
    <p>They cover the nomenclature and categories of 'usability' found in the
      literature extensively from many authors and further literature surveys,
      as a basis for introducing their own statistical aggregation measures.</p>
    <p>They reference an ISO standard around usability which should play a part
      in the literature review.</p>
    <h2>Field of Study</h2>
    <p>UX, User Experience, Usability, Text corpus analysis, natural language
      processing, end user reviews</p>

    <h2>Concepts</h2>

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    "We (a) find that 13%–49% of sentences in our online reviews pool contain
    usability or UX information; (b) chart the distribution of four sets of
    dimensions of usability and UX across reviews from two product categories;
    (c) extract a catalogue of important word stems for a number of dimensions."<br>
    <p>"The aim of this paper is to quantify the amount of UUX information and
      dimensions in online reviews from the specific domains of software and
      video games. We also implement and test a machine-learning-based
      classifier that tags sentences in reviews according to whether they
      contain usability or UX-related information and according to the
      dimensions of usability or UX they pertain to."<br>
    </p>
    <p>"traditional studies focus on short term product use (median 30 minutes
      duration [19]) and conducted in lab settings; few studies stretch across
      longer time periods and then only weeks [19]." [citing Hornbæk, K. 2006]</p>
    <p>"There are important caveats when assessing the potential usefulness of
      online reviews: It is not clear whether online reviews are written by
      users typical of the user base; in addition, very few details about
      reviewers (e.g. gender, age, preferences) are available, in contrast to
      standard usability studies. Furthermore, some reviews may be fake."</p>
    <p>"A more fine-grained description of usability is obtained by the
      following five dimensions which, with some variation in the naming of the
      aspects, are often used for measuring and describing usability in models
      and literature: (i) Effectiveness/Errors, (ii) Efficiency, (iii)
      Satisfaction, (iv) Learnability, (v) Memorability." [CH: extensive
