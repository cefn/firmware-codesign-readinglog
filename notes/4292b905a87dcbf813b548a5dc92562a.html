        <p>"Objects are variously described in the literatures as relatively stable or in-flux; as abstract or concrete; and as used within or across practices. We clarify these dimensions, drawing on and extending the literature on boundary objects, and connecting it with work on epistemic and technical objects."</p>
        <p>"The relationships between these concepts point to the multi-dimensional nature of objects. An object can be at one and the same time a boundary object and a technical object, or a boundary object and an epistemic object. However, objects can also be used in epistemic work without spanning across boundaries of practice."</p>
