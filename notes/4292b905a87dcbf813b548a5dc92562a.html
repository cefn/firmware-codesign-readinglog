      "Objects are variously described in the literatures as relatively stable
      or in-flux; as abstract or concrete; and as used within or across
      practices. We clarify these dimensions, drawing on and extending the
      literature on boundary objects, and connecting it with work on epistemic
      and technical objects."

        <p>
      "The relationships between these concepts point to the multi-dimensional
      nature of objects. An object can be at one and the same time a boundary
      object and a technical object, or a boundary object and an epistemic
      object. However, objects can also be used in epistemic work without
      spanning across boundaries of practice."
