    <h1>SCC204 Software Design : Dr JaeJoon Lee</h1>
    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>8th October 2013 : Introduction</p>
    <p>Described as "software engineering" - first slide</p>
    <p>Requirements engineering</p>
    <p>Usecase Modelling</p>
    <p>Workshops, working as a team on Fridays (for Chris)</p>
    <p>Singular or Group question not heard</p>
    <h2>Books</h2>
    <p>Software Engineering by Ian SOmmerville</p>
    <p>Applying UML and Patterns (Craig Larman)</p>
    <p>Design Patterns</p>
    <h2>Plagiarism warned</h2>
    <p>Don't have any code in the module </p>
    <p>Used example of Airbus as failure of software engineering/requirements.</p>
    <p>Spaghetti process example</p>
    <h2>Software Process</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Software Specification</li>
      <li>Software development</li>
      <li>Software validation</li>
      <li>Software evolution</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Waterfall, incremental, reuse-oriented...other models mentioned (what are
      they, ask Jaejoon).</p>
    <p>"May be plan-driven or agile" for the last two</p>
    <p>Waterfall - difficulty of accommodating change after the process is
      underway. Management decision to use waterfall is to prevent software from
      being iterated - perhaps a tight schedule. Used for large, distributed
      team projects.</p>
    <p>[CH Waterfall Doesn't accept that building is part of the design, and
      also a means of discovery]</p>
    <p>Incremental - develop part of the system, release it as running system.
      Validate with customer, rinse and repeat. Hard to evolve all the documents
      and specifications alongside the design. Needs management discipline and
      commitment.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Break</h2>
    <p>Jaejoon mentioned Feature Oriented Domain Analysis (FODA), developed by
      his supervisor. This is strongly represented in 'product-line engineering,
      and could easily be used to engage non-programmers.</p>
    <h2>Example - toilet in plane</h2>
    <p>Example, sink - simple embedded system, but it has software in it. In his
      case, the hot water triggered itself (which was looking for hand-heat) and
      then caused a loop which caused all the water to flow out and auto-flush
      the toilet.</p>
    <p>Water flow - how long? Easy to forget this in specifications. Must
      establish traceability in requirements and their mapping to code.</p>
    <p>Formal way, use case, plain text - which is the best way to describe the
      requirements. What are the trade offs. Communications are really
      important.</p>
    <h2>What is a requirement?</h2>
    <p>A property that a system must exhibit in order for it to satisfy the
      user.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The property is what is required.</li>
      <li>How it is exhibited varies according to the type of requirement</li>
      <li>Users may not be the only agent the system must satisfy (could be
        another system), and not all users are the same.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Functional vs. Non-functional requirements</p>
    <p>A 'pete sawyer' definition of software requirements.</p>
    <p>Requirements may conflict, be higher priority than others, (incoming
      phone call versus camera use) cost more than others.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h1>Use Cases</h1>
    <p>Role of use cases in 'requirements discovery'.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>from our understanding</li>
      <li>don't ask what user's want</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example of camera phone - taking picture when call comes in - work with
      stakeholders</p>
    <p>Use case 'describes how a system responds to stimuli from 'outside' the
      system</p>
    <ul>
      <li>as a diagram</li>
      <li>as a set of descriptions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Use Case diagram contains Actors, Use cases, System boundary (what you're
      implementing - e.g. database could be outside). Each 'use case' is an
      ellipse containing a verb and a noun.</p>
    <p>Requirements are extracted from use cases, and translate into the system's
      own terms, with more detail.</p>
