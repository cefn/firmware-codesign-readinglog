    <p>"Although design-based research has the potential to offer a useful
      method-<br>
      ological toolkit to those researchers committed to understanding variables
      within<br>
      naturalistic contexts, there are many unresolved questions that we as a
      commu-<br>
      nity must address if our assertions are going to be deemed credible and
      trustwor-<br>
      thy to others. Some questions are: What are the core foci of design-based
      re-<br>
      search and what delineates it from other forms of research? What counts as<br>
      reasonable and useful warrants for advancing assertions investigated
      through this<br>
      type of research? What are the boundaries of a naturalistic context? How
      do we<br>
      control researcher bias in selecting evidence, in reporting observations,
      and in<br>
      developing trustworthy claims? How do we understand the contextuality of<br>
      reserach claims generated in situ and use them to inform broader
      practice?"</p>
