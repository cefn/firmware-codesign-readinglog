        <p>"Although design-based research has the potential to offer a useful method-<br/>ological toolkit to those researchers committed to understanding variables within<br/>naturalistic contexts, there are many unresolved questions that we as a commu-<br/>nity must address if our assertions are going to be deemed credible and trustwor-<br/>thy to others. Some questions are: What are the core foci of design-based re-<br/>search and what delineates it from other forms of research? What counts as<br/>reasonable and useful warrants for advancing assertions investigated through this<br/>type of research? What are the boundaries of a naturalistic context? How do we<br/>control researcher bias in selecting evidence, in reporting observations, and in<br/>developing trustworthy claims? How do we understand the contextuality of<br/>reserach claims generated in situ and use them to inform broader practice?"</p>
