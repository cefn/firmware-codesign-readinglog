      decade the nexus between theory and practice has been a point of debate
      within the contemporary arts school both in Australia and overseas. This
      paper attempts to reveal ways of approaching this issue from within and

      competing and overlapping perspectives and paradigms (and is familiar with

      variety of interpretive paradigms that can be brought to a problem,
      drawing on Feminism, Marxism, Cultural studies, Constructivism, and
      including processes of phenomenography, grounded theory, visual analysis,
      narratology, ethnography, case and field study, structuralism and
      poststructuralism, triangulation, survey etc."</p>
