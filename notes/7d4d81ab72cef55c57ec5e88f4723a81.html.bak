    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;They have explored using paper prototyping and ethnography within a
      HCI course, teaching computer scientists. I like their distinction between
      a Software Designer and a Software Engineer. Resonates very strongly with
      my own view.</p>

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"Software designers need to apply methods that provide insights into the
      user's mental model of the application's target task and to invite the
      user to be an active participant in the design process."</p>
    <p>"While the software programmer/engineer is concerned with developing
      reliable, robust, and maintainable software, the software designer is
      concerned with creating products that fit within the user's overall
      activities, enhance productivity, and produce a satisfying experience"</p>
    <p>"Left to their own devices, computer programmers take a "systems-centered
      point of view", concerned about "how the software works and what parts of
      it do what" [8, p. 217-218]."</p>
