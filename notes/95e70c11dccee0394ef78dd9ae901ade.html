      "this article focuses on that subset of GOMS research that has reached
      sufficient maturity to be tools in the engineer’s toolbox of design"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The overall motivation for GOMS and other HCI cognitive modeling efforts
      is to provide engineering models of human performance. In the ideal, such
      models produce a priori quantitative predictions of performance at an
      earlier stage in the development process than prototyping and user
      testing...That is, they predict execution time, learning time, errors,
      and they identify those parts of an interface that lead to these
      predictions, thereby providing a focus for redesign effort."
    </p>
    <p>
      "rather than replacing user testing, the current engineering models are
      best viewed as reducing the amount of user testing required to develop a
      highly usable system"

      "<em><strong>goals</strong></em> are simply the user’s goals, as defined
      in layman’s language"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<em><strong>Operators</strong></em> are the actions that the software
      allows the user to take"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<em><strong>Methods</strong></em> are well-learned sequences of subgoals
      and operators that can accomplish a goal"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<em><strong>Selection rules</strong></em> are the personal rules that
      users follow in deciding what method to use in a particular circumstance"
