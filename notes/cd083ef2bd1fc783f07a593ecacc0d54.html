        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>Talk about stimulating the creativity of users, and allowing them to challenge designers, through 'design games'. They mostly point to other papers which discuss the concrete projects they did. Mostly this paper is about Wittgenstein and 'language games' and the parallel in terms of forms of life/practice and difficulty of 'translation where design workshops containing both designers and users.</p>

        <p>"The view that genuine user participation can be accomplished as a quick-and-dirty method, often leads to the participants being used merely as informants. Thereby the potential for innovation and creativity of the users [8], and their potential to challenge the assumptions and design ideas, stays untapped."</p>
        <p>"On one hand we have the language-game of the designers, involving concepts from the field<br/>of design. On the other hand we have the language-game of the users and stakeholders which is grounded in their work-practice and involving concepts from their work domain. The question of communication between these two distinct practices is not a trivial one. Therefore organizing a way for designers and users to develop a common language becomes paramount for a successful design process." [discussing Ehn "Work oriented design of computer artefacts"]</p>
        <p>"it is important to attend to how these games are designed by making the tacit knowledge in the process explicit, as addressed by Friis when discussing design processes in general"</p>
