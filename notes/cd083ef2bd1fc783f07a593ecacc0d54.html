        Speak, Would We Understand Them? Design Games &amp; Genuine User
        Participation</a></h1>
    <h2>Authors</h2>
    <p>Jonas Moll, Dave Müller, Martin Baeré Pedersen</p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Talk about stimulating the creativity of users, and allowing them to
      challenge designers, through 'design games'. They mostly point to other
      papers which discuss the concrete projects they did. Mostly this paper is
      about Wittgenstein and 'language games' and the parallel in terms of forms
      of life/practice and difficulty of 'translation where design workshops
      containing both designers and users. </p>
    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>"The view that genuine user participation can be accomplished as a
      quick-and-dirty method, often leads to the participants being used merely
      as informants. Thereby the potential for innovation and creativity of the
      users [8], and their potential to challenge the assumptions and design
      ideas, stays untapped."</p>
    <p>"On one hand we have the language-game of the designers, involving
      concepts from the field<br>
      of design. On the other hand we have the language-game of the users and
      stakeholders which is grounded in their work-practice and involving
      concepts from their work domain. The question of communication between
      these two distinct practices is not a trivial one. Therefore organizing a
      way for designers and users to develop a common language becomes paramount
      for a successful design process." [discussing Ehn "Work oriented design of
      computer artefacts"]</p>
    <p>"it is important to attend to how these games are designed by making the
      tacit knowledge in the process explicit, as addressed by Friis when
      discussing design processes in general"</p>
