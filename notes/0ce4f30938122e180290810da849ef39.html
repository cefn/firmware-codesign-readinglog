        <p>"Partial but critical feedback in design is provided by the 'back-talk of the situation'" [credited to Schoen 83]</p>
        <p>"designers can become aware of a breakdown. This awareness is triggered by evaluation and appreciation of the current design stage (artifact) in tenns of the task at hand (goal). The evaluation is done either by the designers themselves. or by outside agents"</p>
        <p>"The domain orientation of our environments allows us to capture breakdowns as they occur in the problem domain in which designers may violate design principles by overlooking them or being unaware of them, or may violate unknown and unarticulated constraints." [constraint concepts credited to Lee 92 - a book by a TV news anchor about 'the computer crisis' - when software design issues have real-world consequences]<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Â£ directly underpins Reconciliation</span>
