      Introduce the term "design discourse agent" which captures the design
      problem of boundary objects for firmware co-design workshops.

      "Creative design work is seen as a tight interplay<br/>
      between problem setting and problem solving. In this interplay,<br/>
      the design space is explored through the creation of many<br/>
      parallel ideas and concepts. The given assumptions regarding<br/>
      the problem are questioned on all levels. Creative design work is<br/>
      inherently unpredictable. Hence, the designer plays a personal<br/>
      role in the process" [Credited to Lowgren]

      "A <em>
                <strong>design discourse agent</strong>
            </em> is a design artifact
      whose<br/>
      production creates a suggestive state that the designer in<br/>
      turn reacts to and is able to push forward. It is a tool for<br/>
      perpetuating alternatives, suggesting different ways of<br/>
      looking at something, and attempting to clarify a situation."
    </p>
        <p>
      "<em>
                <strong>Communication or knowledge artifacts</strong>
            </em> visually
      articulate<br/>
      design thinking to capture it in a way from which others<br/>
      might draw insight or build upon."
    </p>
        <p>
      "communication artifacts that serve the end result but are not themselves
      end results"
    </p>
        <p>
      "Creative design is not arbitrary or illusive; designers adhere<br/>
      to a design process that enforces design rigor. Design<br/>
      evolves by applying design judgment and engaging in a<br/>
      variety of practices. Sketching provides an alternative to<br/>
      prototyping and iteration. Discussion with clients and briefs<br/>
      allow for requirements elicitation. Design critiques allow a<br/>
      structured means for determining whether a design adheres<br/>
      to good practice and confirming that design judgment was<br/>
      carefully rendered throughout all aspects of the design. We<br/>
      believe that discussion about rigor, key to the design<br/>
      critique, can be presented in written form and have<br/>
      provided an example appropriate for the CHI community."
