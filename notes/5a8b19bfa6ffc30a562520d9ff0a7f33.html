        <p>"How can practice-based research from humanities and informatics conjoin (and diverge) in the practices and analyses of digital design? Are our findings different from those of other, related fields, such as visual design or urban planning, and in which ways do our specific theoretical and methodological approaches contribute to this? What are the relationships between modes of knowing and analysis drawn from the insights and practices of, respectively, designers and researchers?"</p>
        <p>"Digital design calls for an expanded concept of design, as working with the digital is different from other forms of designing. The digital opens up a discussion between research approaches grounded in technological design and in socio-cultural and humanistic inquiries"</p>
        <p>"This also calls for a reframing of the notion of use, shifting attention from a narrow concept of product use to the context and practices of use. Design is a situated social practice, and the designed artefacts can only be fully understood in use. Taking into account the evolving and often-participatory character of digital designs, we even have to consider designing for design after design, the design that users carry out in use (Ehn 2007; Telier et al. (forthcoming)). We can also look at situated use as where the idea behind the artefact and the reality of use meet."</p>
        <p>"Research in PD involves users as co-designers in the design process as a way to design artefacts and systems that the users themselves<br/>consider of benefit to their activities"</p>
        <p>"Understanding the contextual complexities opens up a whole range of new design ideas. We have to add here that foundational to PD and CSCW is a deep commitment to socially embedding technologies in human practice and that both fields of research make use of a diversity of social science methods, among them ethnography. There is a strong overlap with the humanities here"</p>
        <p>"This book attempts a reflexive exploration of the diversity of approaches to digital design research that we seek to confront and combine. The intention of this book has not been to generate a synthesized, grand and unified theory of (digital) design. The authors have different and mixed academic backgrounds: informatics, information systems, pedagogy, anthropology, discourse analysis, linguistics, semiotics (new) media studies and literary theory, among others. We strongly believe that this diversity is a strength when moving into critical and reflective analysis of digital design and its contexts of construction and use. None of the perspectives or theories put forward in this book claims priority over others. The fact that our research is grounded in different epistemological traditions has been one of the main challenges in writing collaboratively."</p>
