    <p>"The overarching problem that this paper addresses is how interaction
      designers express the dynamics of interaction: from user interface
      elements to the design concept and the business relations that surround
      it."</p>
    <p>"Sketching is a particularly quick way to create and assess design
      alternatives. As the<br>
      designer sketches, the representation of a design idea creates further
      ideas, and helps the<br>
      designers to reframe their design problem. In fact, the sketch can precede
      the thought<br>
      and hence drive the cognitive process"</p>
    <p>"Designers reflect on their sketches in both acts of “seeing as” and acts
      of “seeing that” (Goldschmidt,<br>
      1991). Seeing-as stimulates new ideas, while seeing-that prompts
      assessment of<br>
      consequences"</p>
    <p>"In interaction design, computer prototypes are usually built to
      represent and communicate the dynamics of a working interactive system.
      Before such prototypes can be built, however, the dynamics must be
      represented in other ways and state transition charts are one such way."</p>
    <p>"One of the key techniques, in the creativity technique called synectics,
      is personal analogies: participants are encouraged to imagine what it
      would be like to be the system or a component of the system" [attributed
      to Cross 2000]</p>
