Year: 2012 Author/s: Irfan Zeb &amp; Shah Fahad Supervisor: Bertil Lind Abstract Today’s business and IT systems have strongly focused on effective communication. The communication based on poor foundation might create huge communication problems for the system designer and user. These communication problems have a severe impact on the efficiency of information system and most importantly when it comes to the building of a new information system through co design process. For any business organization, IT plays a huge role these days. Although this is not given much emphasis sometimes, it is important to understand that the use of IT in business cannot be taken for granted because it is viewed as part of business organization these days. The business needs to continuously make investments in their IT systems. This will not only help the organization, but the industry as a whole. Effective communication is extremely important for business and IT systems now-a-days. With the help of this particular thesis, the importance of effective communication would have been reflected accordingly. The purpose of this research is therefore to analyze the communication problem between the designer and user during co-design mainly in the field of business and information technology and to create an understanding for how it is possible to create a better communication between the different parties in system development through co-design. Research can also be classified on the basis of the structure of the problem to be solved into exploratory, descriptive and casual research. The research can be regarded as exploratory research because large amounts of data can be gathered from the past researches and literature. Exploratory research explores the parameters of the problems in order to identify what should be measured and how best to undertake a study. In this research the qualitative data is gathered through detailed interviews and literature review. This helps in better understanding through words. Data is generated through the method of triangulation. The results will be presented using detailed analysis of data gathered from interviews and the analysis of theoretical part. It is a very challenging task to meet the changing needs of the business world. Designing effective information technology for this purpose is also very challenging. The co-design of business and IT systems has a lot of benefits for the organizations. The information technology is basically used to support business and its functions. Therefore it is extremely important that the information technology is aligned with the business processes. It should be considered as a part of the business and should not be designed independently.</region>

      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="9" confidence="possible">Effective Communication is important for managers in the companies in order to perform the fundamental management functions, i.e., Planning, Leading, Organizing, and Controlling. Communication facilitates managers to execute their jobs as well as responsibilities. Communication provides a foundation for planning. All the vital information should be communicated to the managers who consecutively should communicate the plans in order to apply them. Organizing also needs efficient communication with others regarding their job task. Hence, we can say that “effective communication is a basic element of successful business”. In other words, communication works as blood of organization. Strong literature review as well as strong capabilities towards research methodology and analytical part will certainly enhances the productivity of this thesis and will furnish good understandings among the readers.

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="41" page="7" column="1">Today‘s business and IT systems have strongly focused on effective communication. The communication based on poor foundation might create huge communication problems for the system designer and user. These communication problems have a severe impact on the efficiency of information system and most importantly when it comes to the building of a new information system through co design process (Kecheng, Liu &amp; Lily Sun, 2002). For any business organization, IT plays a huge role these days. Although this is not given much emphasis sometimes, it is important to understand that the use of IT in business cannot be taken for granted because it is viewed as part of business organization these days. The business needs to continuously make investments in their IT systems. This will not only help the organization, but the industry as a whole. Usually there is a huge gap between an IT system being operated in a company and the requirements for the organization. At one particular time IT system might be great and supportive to the business but after a certain period of time, it can prove to be a constraint to that business and its operations. One of the reasons for this problem could be that there is a lack of integration between IT systems and business processes. There is a need to design them together rather than treating them separately because eventually, the IT systems being used in the organization are required to support business processes. This may lead to re-designing the IT systems which can be extremely costly for the organization (Kecheng &amp; Lily, 2002). Many organizations have tried looking for flexible and evolutionary IT systems. The only way to remove the gap between an organization‘s IT systems and its processes is to make sure that the IT system is regarded as part of the organization. <marker type="block"/> IT involves the use of computers or telecommunication tools to receive, store and transmit data and information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18" id="31" class="deo:Reference">John, 2009</xref>). The essence of technology is extremely important from the standpoint of a company and from the standpoint of an economy as well (Edwin &amp; Ruud, 2010). Among numerous technologies, the technology of social networks is one of them which emerged tremendously well in the current world from the last few years (Edwin &amp; Ruud, 2010).<marker type="block"/> Effective communication is one of the basics from the perspective of an organization as it has a direct relation with the long run economic benefit of the organization. At present, the practice of effective communication is very significant for all fields in spite of if it relates to business or Information technology (IT). In accordance with many professionals of organization, the communication barriers always create problems for the organizations. Effective Communication is important for managers in the companies in order to do the fundamental management functions, that is, Planning, Organizing, Controlling and Leading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R67" id="33" class="deo:Reference">Aquinas, 2007</xref>). Communication facilitates managers to do their jobs as well as responsibilities. Communication serves like a foundation for planning. All essential information should be communicated to the managers who sequentially should communicate<marker type="page" number="8"/><marker type="block"/> the plans in order to apply them. Organizing also needs effective communication with others regarding their job task. Likewise leaders like managers should communicate efficiently with their juniors in order to attain the team objectives. Controlling is impossible without documented and verbal communication. Managers dedicate a huge part of their time in communication. They usually dedicate about 6 hours each day in communication. They spend large time on direct or telephonic communication with their seniors, subordinates, coworkers, consumers or suppliers. Managers also utilize written communication in the letters, reports or memos form where oral communication is not possible (Kecheng, Liu &amp; Lily Sun, 2002).<marker type="block"/> Co design is a Process of collecting ideas, knowledge, experiences, of all the Stockholders, practitioner, and governing body related to a process, system, activity to achieve such a standard that is acceptable to all. The concept of co-design is often used in different settings. A co design can be common solutions between businesses or considerations to dissimilar parties in the designing process. Co-designs hold a lot of significance for tacit knowledge. In co-design there is an understanding that all human objects are designed and with a purpose. In co-design one attempt to contain those viewpoints which are associated to the design in the process. The design quality rises if the interests of stakeholders are considered in the design process (Albinsson &amp; Lind, 2007).<marker type="block"/> During the process of designing any product or service, the involvement and participation of user or customer is extremely important. There is also a need to study in detail the needs and requirements of the users. The involvement of the user and development of a product or service leads us to understand that the understanding of the user‘s needs is crucial and then they can be used to make the design process more effective and efficient. The collaboration between user and designer helps in the design process. This is most beneficial during the initial stages of the design process because it helps in understanding the mental model of the user and his needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34" id="38" class="deo:Reference">Huxham, 1991</xref>). Some of the major characteristics of good user designer collaboration include: shared background or circumstances and unreceptive objectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39" id="39" class="deo:Reference">JongHo, Vesna, Thea &amp; KunPyo, 2007</xref>).<marker type="block"/> In economic environment of today, any downtime influencing vital business systems may cause permanent damage to productivity of an organization, status and profits (David &amp; Harris, 1998). Both SME (Small Medium Enterprises) as well as enterprises have prioritized stability of business and recovery of catastrophe as top technology plans over the next 12 months, and 1/3 or more are planning to enhance their expenditure by as a minimum of 5 percent this year. Businesses are faced by several kinds of risks which can interrupt internal as well as external communications. Though pandemics, security violation, and acts of war get a great deal of media attention, more everyday events for example failures of infrastructure and network system are supposed as more possible by IT and business management (David &amp; Harris, 1998).</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="48" page="9" column="1">Certainly, one of the most important parts of a research report is the problem statement part, in which the researcher investigates the things accordingly. The part of the research problem is the one that has a strong correlation with the aims and objectives of the research. The reader can get a detailed idea after having a look at the research problem. <marker type="block"/> Business people and IT experts are living in totally different environments and these differences lead them to the different expertise. These experiences are impacting on their perception and the way of thinking toward the new information system. For example their language, a system designer expresses the ideas in their language of understanding and sometimes it is difficult for a system user to follow their language. Discussion in co-design process it can happen that an idea is explained in a totally different way by the stakeholders and in this discussion, some expressions perhaps may not be understandable for other stakeholders.<marker type="block"/> The concept of mental models is very important to understand while studying the co-design process. Since the mental models of participants in a co-design are different, there is a possibility that one‘s ideas and knowledge converge or diverge with others. If the mental models of the participants are similar then some important aspects of problem solving might be overlooked. This might lead to problems in the system‘s design and cause problems for the users. That is the reason why communication between designers and users in the design process is given so much importance.<marker type="block"/> The problem is that user designer collaboration is essential during the design process and it can be used to understand the latent needs of user. This is essential during the initial stages of the design process. However, strategic views have not been developed regarding how user designer collaboration can be made an important part of the design process. Therefore there is a need to identify a method that can be used for collaboration and communication between user and designer during the initial stages of product development process.<marker type="block"/> The research problem of this particular research depends upon 7Ws and 1H:  What is Effective Communication all about?  How the barrier to communication hurts an organization?  Why effective communication is the heart of the organization?  When the problems of barriers in effective communication arise?  What are the characteristics for good usability?  What aspects should be considered to enhance usability through co-design?  What will the mutual influence of the mental models of the participants in co-design mean for the efficiency of the process?  What aspects should be considered to decrease misunderstandings in developing an information system in an intercultural environment?</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="51" page="10" column="1">The main purpose of the study is to find out the factors that would help in creating a better communication system between the IT designer and User system just according to the needs of the business. It will increase system usability and business efficacy. With the help of this particular thesis, the importance of effective communication would have been reflected accordingly. With the help of theoretical and empirical study answers of the research sub question will be generated. In the theoretical study a foundation will be constructed for co- design factors. The factors that help in creating a better communication between designers and users during co-design are important because the information system is very important for attaining efficiency for an organization and it is important that the information system is an efficient and useful one. Therefore this study finds out the factors and then analyzes the communication problem between the designer and user during co-design mainly in the field of business and information technology and to create an understanding for how it is possible to create a better communication between the different parties in system development through co-design.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="58" page="10" column="1">This research will show to be useful for all organizations as there is no organization which does not engage in designing. Moreover all organizations recently take advantage of IT so as to improve its operations. The groups that may find research of communication problems between designers and users during co-design for IT and businesses beneficial are: Researchers (the results of research may inspire them and may support or reject past research done on this particular topic), Business Organizations (the results might help them improve their design process that would result in greater efficiency and better performance through use <marker type="page" number="11"/><marker type="block"/> of IT systems) and Software Developers (the results might help them design user friendly and efficient software by understanding the mental models of users and understanding their latent needs).<marker type="block"/> It is extremely important to find relevant respondents in order to complete this particular research. The target group for this research would be the people related to the Business and IT field. In order to analyze the importance of effective communication within an organization it is more than important to talk about the same. Hence, people belonging to this particular field will certainly help us to overcome all of such problems. Sony Ericson organization has chosen for the empirical study collection in this study.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="61" page="11" column="1">Another important aspect that is involved in co-design is the concept of shared mental models of participants. It investigates the mental models of participants independent of the mental models of users. That is off course a part of this research to some extent but the focus here is on communication problems between users and designers in co-design. Their effect on learning of team members is also an important concept that could not be made part of the research thesis. The focus of this research is on understanding the communication problems and not the learning outcomes for an organization and its members. The design process has a lot of influence on the learning of team members so this would also be an interesting topic of research. The communication problems among the design team only is also a topic that could not become part of this research since it talks more about understanding the mental models of its team members and not users. <marker type="block"/> Things like strategies to make communication smooth and effective in an organization can be regarded as delimitations and can be included in the research and in future we may see the same in the research. The work would open new ways of communication which will certainly become positive and important from the standpoint of an organization. Strategies and models of communication have been defined accordingly in this chapter.</region>

This backdrop study has assisted in forming the major research question as well as three sub-questions. Both the backdrop study and research questions have persuaded the research design in chapter two. The research design engages online data, interviews, documents as well as books that are employed as methods of data extraction. The data produced from these tools is then assessed. Chapter three gives the theoretical frame that contains important ideas, previous significant research and the conclusion to answers of sub questions. Chapter four gives the data produced by chosen tools and the results of sub- questions which have been responded. This will give the research‘s empirical study. Chapter five gives a review of the theoretical and empirical studies‘ results. Finally the last chapter presents the argument most important to a research conclusion.</region>

            <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="78" confidence="possible" page="14" column="1">This research method is used when the research problem is badly understood. The variables of the problem are not known and it is the lack of this knowledge to the researcher which makes it difficult for the researcher to conduct his research. Exploratory research explores the parameters of the problems in order to identify what should be measured and how best to undertake a study. (Robson, 2002) explains that exploratory study is a valuable means of finding out  ̳what is happening; to seek new insights; to ask questions and to assess phenomena in a new light‘ (Saunders, Lewis &amp; Thornhill, 2007, pp.178). This type of research helps to develop a clear formulation of the scope and nature of the research problem. At initial stages of the decision-making process, exploratory research is used for getting a preliminary investigation of the circumstances with low expenses of time as well as money. It engages the preliminary examination of a research area before the key stage of qualitative data collection. The methods used for exploratory research are not structured. These methods allow the researcher to recognize the people from which interview is conducted in the chief data collection stage, and the marketplace which is being researched. In accordance with Adams &amp; Schvaneveldt 1991, pp.89) the flexibility intrinsic in exploratory research does not mean direction absence to the enquiry but that the focus is at first wide and becomes increasingly narrow as the research gets progressed (Saunders, Lewis &amp; Thornhill, 2007, pp.124). The research can be regarded as exploratory research because large amounts of data can be gathered from the past researches and literature.</region>

This method of research is used when the problem is formed and better understood. Under descriptive research the researcher is aware of one of the problem‘s variables that make it simple for him/her to resolve the problem. The researcher is aware of the goal to be achieved which gives him/her a certain direction to conduct the research. For example: television soap wants to find out about its</region>

            <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="84" page="15" column="1">The basic purpose of this research is to explore the effect that one thing has on the other. It is basically the effect of one variable on the other variable. This kind of research basically tries to investigate the effect of one change on the set standards or traditions. A business dealing in clothes, that sell for example shirts, casual research can be used to find out the effect of changing the jeans cut, design or its color. This research will help in finding out if these changes in the product will prove to be beneficial for the company in terms of sales of profits. In any situation where a certain variable is changing or affecting the other, like in this case the changes in product design have an effect on the profitability of the company, this kind of research should be undertaken. Basically to find out cause and effect relationship, casual research is best. In this research usually one variable is held constant and changes in the other are measured. The one that causes the change is usually held constant. It is actually a quite complicated method of research. It is hard for the researcher to be sure that no other factor is having an impact on the relationship. This is most common when observing the behavior and actions of people. Sometimes there are deeper emotional and mental concerns which are not seen or ignored by the researcher.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="105" page="15" column="1">The term paradigm refers to the progress of scientific practice based on people‘s philosophies and assumptions about the world and the nature of knowledge; in this context, about how research should be conducted. Paradigms are  ̳generally identified scientific achievements which for a time give model problems as well as solutions to a practitioner‘s community (Murphy, 2007 pp.90). They give a framework including an accepted theories set, methods and techniques of explaining data. There are two key paradigms or philosophies of research: positivist and phenomenological. Theoretical paradigms help in determining the perspectives through which research is planned and carried out (Krauss, 2005). <marker type="block"/> Most of the research traditionally has been carried out through positivist perspective. It is also called the scientific method for research. It is a theoretical structure that does not contrast between social and real world. In this research all the generalizations are made through quantitative research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56" id="87" class="deo:Reference">Nagel, 1986</xref>). The positivist perspective argues that all the genuine knowledge comes from deductive interpretation. The scientific observation is the result of theory. This perspective has helped in overcoming a lot of difficulties faced by organizations.<marker type="page" number="16"/><marker type="block"/> Still it has failed in tackling the social challenges related to individuals in research relate to organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42" id="90" class="deo:Reference">Lee, 1991</xref>). The basic aim of this positivist approach is to provide predictions on the basis of isolated, quantitative research. This approach is based mostly on observing and assumes that everything is based on laws. Positivism is a traditional view that science follows and science also puts great emphasis on quantitative research. The quantitative analysis can be done by observation and this provides a definition for things. In this perspective the observation is supposed to be done in such a way that there is no direct contact between the two individuals; the one observing and the one being observed. There has to be a good distance between these two individuals otherwise the quality of research can deteriorate. Some of the important points that need to be kept in mind for this research include conducting the research through quantitative methods and making observations in a careful manner under controlled conditions. This helps in maintaining the quality of research and not letting anything influence it. For verification, the hypothesis made is empirically tested (Guba &amp; Lincoln, 1994). One of the major principles this approach follows is that everything needs to be verified; otherwise it is useless (Blaikie. 2007). Positivism can be divided into three categories. The first category is of laws based on reality and sciences that can be verified through observing distinct experiences. The second category is Logical Positivism that came into existence in 1920s. According to this theory needs to be based on experience and it should be something that can be observed. The third category is known as the standard view whose major aim is to identify universal laws. Those things that cannot be tested or verified are considered to be useless according to positivism. The reason why social sciences cannot follow this approach mostly is that they cannot be explained in experimental terms.<marker type="block"/> The phenomenological approach in contrast to positivist approach is inductive in nature and focuses on meanings rather than facts. Phenomenology is a theoretical viewpoint which supports the direct experience study taken at face value; and one that observes behavior as determined by the experience phenomena rather than by external, object and physically defined reality (Remenyi, Williams, Money &amp; Swartz, 1998 pp.90). Phenomenologist does not believe the world to contain a reality of objective but in its place emphasizes on the dominance of subjective realization. Every situation is seen as distinctive and its meaning is a function of the situation and the individuals concerned. To the phenomenologist the researcher is not independent of what is being done research but is a basic part of it. The phenomenology paradigm is related with consideration of human behavior from the contributors own context. It is assumed that social reality lies within us and therefore the act of investigating reality has an effect on that reality. This qualitative approach stresses the subjective aspects of human activity by focusing on the meaning, rather than the measurement, of social phenomena.<marker type="block"/> To varying degrees, phenomenologist believes that social reality relies in the mind. There is no reality independent of the mind; therefore, what is researched cannot be unaffected by the process of the research (Murphy, 2007 pp.90). To utilize phenomenological method the researcher must look beyond the description of the situation to recognize the actuality or possibly a reality working behind them. The researcher builds a sense in terms of the situation being studied. In consider using of both qualitative or quantitative method, lots of authors<marker type="page" number="17"/><marker type="block"/> propose that a mixture of the two techniques would give for more standpoints being examined. There is an increasing recognition of the need for incorporating the different methods to assessment. The rationale for the selection being, unlike the banks with a particular emphasize on various chosen organizations. It is the owner who is responsible for the overall well being of the firm. The owner‘s view point has a direct affect on the firm and not all the aspects are quantifiable. As far as the choice for research paradigm is concerned, the researcher is more inclined towards using the phenomenological approach. The reason behind this choice lies in the objectives of this thesis. As the thesis is dealing with financial crunch management strategies among, which are formulated by the owner of the small firm keeping in mind a number of factors and personal choice, which is not objective in nature. In order to reach the aim of this thesis a deeper understanding is required. This in-depth knowledge is basically concerned with how the current economic downturn is managed within UK‘s and how all factors affect this management. Qualitative research methods are very useful in terms of acquiring an in-depth understanding of complex interrelations and human phenomena.<marker type="block"/> The interpretivist and positivist perspectives differ from each other because of following different approaches. This research is supported by interpretivist perspective. According to this perspective, the knowledge about reality is considered to be a social structure interpreted by humans. A paradigm is a loose link of assumptions and concepts that are logically related to each other and lead to research or thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81" id="96" class="deo:Reference">Walsham, 2001</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="97" class="deo:Reference">Bogdan &amp; Biklen, 1998</xref>). This research involves using the interpretivist perspective. This perspective has shown many benefits for information systems research in the field of studying organizations. Subjective reasoning of results of any research is what makes any study valuable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4" id="98" class="deo:Reference">Bhattacharya, 2008</xref>). Interpretivism is related to subjectivity and objectivity is related to positivism. Interpretivist perspective argues that there are considerable differences between real and social world. That is the reason why the logic behind natural sciences can be applied to social studies. In the case of the natural world, consistent results can be observed as a result of actions. In the case of social studies, irregular results can be observed in reaction to various situations. The individuals do not perform the same results or actions as in the case of sciences. The individuals react differently in different situations according to their ideas, knowledge and beliefs. The goal of interpretivism is to understand the actions and behaviors of the subjects under study and to find out how they act or react according o their perceptions and habits. Every individual builds his/her own understanding of the situations and act according to that. Objective studies basically focus on underlying relations between events and relies on hypothesis more than observation. Social sciences on the other hand are more inclined towards subjective experiences. Weber mostly focused on understanding the actions of individuals and relationships among them. These were the social actions and relationships. According to him sociology is a science aims to achieve an interpretive understanding of social actions which leads to an explanation of cause and effect (Weber, 1971). According to Winch behavior results from a kind of rule following which was driven by language. He found a major link between social behavior and language. Language is a medium of social interaction and everyday conceptions shape reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="99" class="deo:Reference">Blaikie, 2007</xref>). Interpretivist perspective opposes many of the concepts and ideas of positivism which are a part of social studies. It<marker type="page" number="18"/><marker type="block"/> influences people‘s lives by studying their everyday behavior and events occurring in their lives. It helps in understanding the lives and actions of the subjects under study. This is done in a variety of ways, mostly by observing and taking some unstructured interviews. This kind of study helps in generalization by observing certain subjects from a given population. It also helps in formation of theories of social actions or behaviors. Interpretivism involves qualitative research and is mostly used in those kinds of researches where detailed explanations are required and experiences are given importance. The researchers following this approach tend to understand phenomenon that is based on interpreting meanings which lead to a biased understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63" id="102" class="deo:Reference">Orlikowski &amp; Baroudi, 1991</xref>). The ontological viewpoint of interpretivisim believes that our perception of the world is based solely on our experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4" id="103" class="deo:Reference">Bhattacharya, 2008</xref>). Interpretivist approach is mostly used for studies based on organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63" id="104" class="deo:Reference">Orlikowski &amp; Baroudi, 1991</xref>). This proves that organizational behavior is judged by social systems that are represented and based on human actions. Vreed (1995) says that for Organizational Science and IS research; interpretive research was more of a custom. According to interpretivism, the facts about actions can be formed but they are situation dependent. They cannot be applied to every person at any time or situation. That is the reason why the reality of social world is not fixed and is best described by experiences and perspectives of those who are involved (Chris, 2006). In case of subjects or areas where there cannot be a proper definition of the world, this perspective is used. The research area we are dealing with is related to the communication problems between designers and users which are dependent on the situations, the personality of designers and users, their mental models, the timing and setting. Therefore, the best approach to define relit is by considering the perspective of those (designers and users) involved in co-design process. This is particularly the reason why interpretivist perspective is used for this research. This was until the 1970s that things changed. Qualitative or quantitative data may be generated through this research. Since qualitative data is descriptive and focuses on creating an understanding from words, our research will be making use of it.</region>

Lots of research methodologies may be employed such as experiments, case studies, surveys, descriptive research or forecasting. The methodology which will be used for this research is survey. A survey assists in giving data regarding situations and observes at a particular time. This may be made by interviews or questionnaires. Then quantitative methods are used to illustrate conclusions from data regarding the present relations. The fundamental benefit which surveys provide is that you can analyse too much one variable at a time. Not only can you know the relationship between a dependant and independent variable, but also recognize the independent variables‘ effect on each other. In survey, main data is principally used for study, be it gathered from in- depth interviews or large scale questionnaires.</region>

It relates to reaching a conclusion based on the experiments and observation made by the researcher based on the facts and figures collected. A huge amount of academic research conducted nowadays depends on empirical methods that supports factual for the physical and natural worlds, and the social world. The validation behind this prejudice for empiricism is a philosophical supposition that proof, as opposed to thinking or discussion is needed to be capable to build a acceptable claim to have increases the body of knowledge (Remenyi, Williams, Money &amp; Swartz, 1998, pp.67). Thought it is not always simple to gather functional evidence that can cause inducing and credible outcomes. An empiricist carries out his observation by going out into the world and observing through experiment or even by relative passive observation of what is happening. By studying these observations and collecting related evidence, the empiricist will draw conclusions and make the claim that something of value has been added to the body of knowledge. The research which is undergoing in a continuing phase can be regarded as empirical research because after the economic downturn lots of researches have been proposed in this area.</region>

A research theorist studies the subject through the writings of others and through discourse with learned of informed individuals who can comment on the subject area, usually without any direct involvement in observation of behavior and the collection of actual evidence (Remenyi, Williams, Money &amp; Swartz, 1998, pp.102). The theorist then reflects on these ideas and using his or her intellectual capabilities constructs a new or different view of the situation, which sometimes may be regarded as a new theory.

It is not possible to carry out an empirical research without having clarity of thought about the theoretical issues surrounding the subject which will be studied and about which evidence will be collected. It is well accepted that what is observed is often and largely a function of the preconceptions that scientists bring to the problem. A paradigm or theory is no more than the conventional wisdom of the subject. Hence empirical research must be basically entrenched in theory and it is not possible to conduct this research in a significant way without the researcher taking a particular theoretical viewpoint (Remenyi, Williams, Money &amp; Swartz, 1998, pp.108).

Theoretical research does not occur in vacuum, it is rather the result of thinking about the findings of previous empirical research and debating the different theoretical interpretations that others have made (Remenyi, Williams, Money &amp; Swartz, 1998, pp.123). Keeping in mind the above discussion a mix of the two approaches would be adopted to carry out the research. Theories from the literature review would be taken to support the working capital models which are applicable to the UK‘s SMEs and suggestions would be made based on observation of their working and data collected.</region>

Then only a system according to user needs can be designed. Interviews were seemed to be best mean to acquire information. Under this method a user can give more in-depth information, which will improve the design such as, besides general requirement, he will share prevailing values and norms in the company, its future plans. In the interviews only, interviewer can ask further questions. Interviews are used for qualitative research in order to understand meanings and experiences more closely. Interviews help in having a conversation with the individuals, the one under study and the one carrying out the study. One important aspect of interviews is how to record the answers. They can be written down on a paper or recorded on tape. Recording is a good method but it takes a lot of time while taking down notes can prove to be better if there is not much distraction and speed is good enough. There is also a need to decide first if the questions are supposed to be open-ended or closed-ended. The interviews can use both of the techniques as well. Closed ended questions help in gathering data about facts usually. They usually do not require detailed answers. Usually the interviewee is given options they can select their answers from. This is usually used when there is a need to turn your data into quantitative data. One major drawback of this is that the response is usually quick and limited, <marker type="page" number="21"/><marker type="block"/> so deep thinking hardly takes place. The interviewee does not get to explain what he/she really feels.<marker type="block"/> In case of open-ended questions a lot of different responses can be observed and recorded. This helps in detailed explanation and expression of real feelings of the interviewee. Given more time to talk, people eventually become more comfortable and let their true feelings out. The drawback this has is that it is not possible to turn the data into quantitative data. There is also a need to read and understand each and everything said by the interviewee and then categorizes them according to the needs or other ways.<marker type="block"/> The requirement of the thesis is to analyse the communication problems between designer and users during co-design for IT and businesses. In order to collect the required data on the communication problem during designing of an information system, interviews are the most effective method. To analyse the effectiveness of the communication problems in co-design process there can be a large number of quantitative indicators as well but obtaining the viewpoint of the design team regarding the problems that might result while designing a product and the problems faced by users later on, this would yield best results as they are aware of the aspects they were expecting.

In the generation of qualitative data a structured method of analyzing qualitative data is used. The data gathered will pass the stages of extracting relevant data first, then accessing the quality of data which is the initial data analysis, then the major data analysis will be done that will relate the gathered data to main research question and finally the data analysis will conclude the data analysis process. All the data generated should be arranged in a proper format that will allow researcher in arrangement of data in such a way that it can be easily navigated. Prior preparations will help in data formatting so that notes prepared by researcher can be inserted easily and new themes can be identified. <marker type="block"/> For outlining the structure of this research, the data analysis methods will mostly be relevant to textual qualitative data. The inductive approach will be used. When the gathered data has gone through the process of analysis, categories of associated and important themes will be formed. These categories will include the data valuable to research, data irrelevant to research, and data with close relevance to the research question. The methods used in analysis of data will help in identifying the patterns in data that will either support the existing concepts related to research or new concepts will be identified. The results of theoretical and empirical studies will help in answering sub questions and then those results will go through a comparative analysis. This will lead to evaluation of data and presentation of results. For preparation of data, qualitative data will be derived through answers gathered from interviews<marker type="page" number="22"/><marker type="block"/> from two informants in the same organization. In order to obtain the dependant variable which is communication between designers and users in co-design, interviewee from technological department will help in understanding the communication issues between designers and users in co-design of information systems.<marker type="block"/> The comparative study will lead to measuring the empirical study based on the results of theoretical study. The framework formed from the results of theoretical study will help in measurement of empirical data and also provide strong basis to find out how relevant the data is. The comparison will be made based on the sub questions of research.<marker type="block"/> Theoretical studies are important in scientific research, because past study has been providing a comprehensive description of the topic and latest studies help us to deal with complex problem of today‘s world. Such as social cognitive theory and health issues, TMA and information systems etc. Mostly theoretical study is used to develop the basic physical understanding of the concept. Empirical research is also another way of getting to know about phenomena by direct or indirect observation or experience. Then these observations are recorded and analyzed qualitatively or quantitatively. For qualitative research generally question are set out and their answers are generated with evidence.

            <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="134" page="22" column="1">To make any qualitative research authentic and valid use of relevant theories in that is must. Theories provide complex and comprehensive conceptual understanding of things that cannot be pinned down: e.g. how people react, how organization work etc. It provided different angles through which researcher can look at the given problem or issues, help them to focus on different aspects in order to set a framework to conduct their analysis. As it is theoretical and empirical study, only theories can strengthen the study. For example to study system designer and user relationship for designing a information system will provide inside about different aspect of the organizational culture, values etc.</region>

            <h3 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="135" page="22" column="1">2.5.2 Technology Acceptance Model</h3>
            <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="146" page="22" column="1">It is an information system theory that models how a user accepts and uses the technology. This model is based on theory of reasoned Action. This model expressed that whenever any technology is presented to user, user‘s perceived usefulness and expect ease will influence his intention to use the system (Davis, F. D. 1989). Perceived usefulness is also affected by perceived ease of use. If user perceives that system is friendly in use and help him to improve his job. He will be keen to know how system works and will overcome any hurdle in learning. But if he perceive that system is not friendly in use, then how hard anyon try he will hesitate to use it. TAM gives a strong belief that when someone has intention to act he will act without any limitation (Davis, F. D. 1989). <marker type="page" number="23"/><marker type="block"/> Production includes input and output factors. Output depends upon the input (Charles ,.Douglas); in this study input is provided by user and designer: whatever system it will become is output. So, here it is utmost duty of the user to give complete information so that designer gets an insight about the whole organization, its working, hierarchy, events, values, standard and policies. Then only a good information system can be designed.<marker type="block"/> Theory of planned behaviour is a theory about the link between attitude and behaviours. Icek Ajzen proposed this theory to enhance the analytical power of the theory of reasoned action by including perceived behavioural control. It studies belief, attitude, behavioural intention and behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1" id="141" class="deo:Reference">Ajzen, Icek 1991</xref>). If people think that their behaviour will have significance impact on the outcome, their intention will be higher to perform. Perceived behavioural control is taken from self efficacy theory. Self efficacy is essential for behavioural change. When a person requires certain outcome and he knows that his behaviour will produce that outcome, he will be confident and motivated to execute that behaviour. In undertaken study when a user knows that his participation, answers, explanation and interest will produce an information system that will be easy to use and meet his requirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R74" id="142" class="deo:Reference">Sniehotta, 2009</xref>). He will exert a positive and friendly behaviour with the designer.<marker type="block"/> Social cognitive theory is a learning theory, people learned from observing others what they do and what they don‘t. It help to understand the deeply the environment, behaviours, and beliefs of the peoples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3" id="145" class="deo:Reference">Bandura, 1989</xref>). In this study designer can observe the organization so that he can gain insight of the company, values, working, environment, policies, and workforce attitude thoroughly. Sometimes, user fail to answers some questions of the designer, in this situation, designer can preferred to observe the normal routine of the working. In this way he can get answers of his questions.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="156" page="23" column="1">To validate the data is extremely significant to ensure that the research is influential and of best quality. The methods for producing qualitative data have become very much covering. The study validity can be reinforced by utilizing techniques of verification. The variables are divided into two different sets, dependent as well as independent. The interviews will give an obvious consideration of what communication issues are between designers and users in <marker type="page" number="24"/><marker type="block"/> process of co-design which result in an information system design not being that competent. The findings will be depended on the study of information offered by interviews from the three interviews from dissimilar hierarchy levels. Because of the validating of qualitative research, cross validation is a broad method. This approach is also known as triangulation. According to O‘<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61" id="150" class="deo:Reference">Donoghue and Punch (2003)</xref>, ―triangulation is a method of cross-checking data from a lot of sources of search for regularities in the research data." This technique helps in analyzing data from numerous sources. This results in knowing and understanding the study results.<marker type="block"/> i. Confirmability : This helps in assuring that research findings are based on researcher‘s perspective of the fact and that the results of such findings can be verified. It is also very important to verify the methods for collection of data. Data may be both qualitative as well as quantitative. We require asking and proving what methods of data collection were used.<marker type="block"/> ii. Dependability: One of the biggest challenges in case of a qualitative research is that its results keep on changing with the changes in the environment. So it can be said that it is dependent on the environment. Therefore, dependability will tell how well the research has been recorded. This can be done by examination of data in different time frames. The data consistency can be tested by examining data in different setting too. The difference in viewpoints should also be tested. There can be a huge difference in point of views of interviewees and survey participants. The basic purpose of this is to test whether the data was collected from reliable source or place.<marker type="block"/> iii. Credibility : Credibility helps in forming a uniform relation between research design parts. There should be a clear relation between the sources and techniques of generating data as well as accuracy and credibility of the informants.<marker type="block"/> iv. Transferability: Transferability means the ability of the research results to be applied to other environments linked to the research phenomenon.<marker type="block"/> v. Ethics: This means that the research is morally right. It includes the rights of people involved in the research. The intellectual and confidentiality are the major aspects to be given importance.</region>

The organizational environment keeps on changing. The information systems also need to keep changing with that. That is how information systems of future will have to perform in order to keep pace with the changing trends and environment. However, it is observed that the information systems are designed through inspiration by program concepts and not by organizational needs. This leads to a huge gap between the system or software and the operations of the organization. The term information technology can also be used for the communication between people, technology and processes. The term is not only used for information and communication technology for businesses but it also refers to how the organizations make us of this technology in order to facilitate the business activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44" id="187" class="deo:Reference">Kroenke, D M, 2008</xref>).</region>

The relevant resources used are for the current research discussed in the next heading whereas this explains the research done previously by other researchers whose work is found to be relevant to this research. The following framework was developed in order to show the interactions between designers and users that go on in co-design process. According to this framework, there are three factors that lead to a better understanding between a designer and a user. The first one is the knowledge and understanding of each person involved in the design process. This is the contribution that comes from each individual. It includes contributions from both the designer and user. The second one is the collective contributors which include a <marker type="page" number="30"/><marker type="block"/> designer‘s knowledge as well as social management activities. The third and last one is the designer‘s management activities.<marker type="block"/> (Karsenty, 1 991 &amp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70" id="215" class="deo:Reference">Robillard, 1998</xref>) researched on the collaboration and meetings of designers and future users of the product or service. They found out some important elements of their meetings which were evaluating, analyzing, clarifying and negotiating their ideas and knowledge for problem solving. The most frequent activity was found to be discussing the design objects and clarifications by designers and users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70" id="216" class="deo:Reference">Robillard, 1998</xref>). According to him collaboration and interaction among designer and user must involve social exchange and individual expression. Therefore it is highly important that during co-design, individual statements as well as paired statements are given value. Usually the designers and users act differently which results in misunderstandings, confusion and interruption. Also frequently observed act is repetition of same ideas which is the result of common knowledge and similar mental models of participants. All the activities; individually and collectively contributed to common knowledge and sharing of knowledge among individuals. Only if the individual and collective contribution activities are understood, it will be easier to find out the problems that occur during the co-design process.<marker type="block"/> The individual contributions come from designers and users. User‘s knowledge is the result of his everyday experiences that shape his/her mental model. It is also based on his product experience, perceptions and preferences. The contributions provided by designers and user must first be clarified for any misunderstandings and the needs and wants of user need to be understood well by the designer. Only then the designer should proceed with the designing. These collaborations help in facilitating the design process. The conversation and activities that go on between designer and user during design process indicate approval, refusal,<marker type="page" number="31"/><marker type="block"/> conformity, disagreement and conformity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13" id="220" class="deo:Reference">Clark and Schaefer, 1989</xref>). According to them, the purpose of involving users can be different for each organization. It can be identification of user needs, evaluation of the usability or acceptability of a product or clarification of design concepts. The collective activities help in the support of forming a common ground between designer and user. Designer‘s management activities help in transferring of knowledge and new ideas among team members in co-design.<marker type="block"/> Participatory design involves utilizing the knowledge of those who deal with technology. It involves the study of their implicit knowledge. The theory of cognition tends to ignore this knowledge which is really important in today‘s interaction of human and technology involving computers etc. It is very difficult to describe the tacit knowledge of users that is why this concept holds significance (Winograd and Flores, 1986; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57" id="222" class="deo:Reference">Nardi, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58" id="223" class="deo:Reference">Nardi and Engestrom, 1999</xref>).<marker type="block"/> Because user‘s tacit knowledge is of very high importance to designers, participatory design tends to find out more about it when designing new systems. This is done in an ethical manner. The knowledge of users is used to develop the technology that would facilitate his work and do not cause any interruptions because of better understanding of user‘s needs. The paradigm that supports participatory design is constructivist in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55" id="225" class="deo:Reference">Mirel, 1998</xref>) sense. According to it knowledge creation is a result of interaction among individuals. It is not something that is just stored in the brains of humans. One of the most important and dominant concept related to participatory design is language game (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25" id="226" class="deo:Reference">Ehn, 1989</xref>). It bridges the gap between designers and users through use of common language or same mode of interaction. Through this a zone of comfort is also created between them.<marker type="block"/> The technology acceptance model has its principles adopted from Fishbein and Ajzen‘s (1975) which are related to the subject of psychology and focused on the attitude paradigm. It helps in specifying the methods for measurement of behaviour related elements of attitude, distinguishing between beliefs and attitudes and specifying how the external stimuli like objective features are linked to beliefs, attitude and behaviour. Hence, the performance impacts linked to the ease of use are logical subset of the ones comprising usefulness. Making the system easy to use, having all other factors constant makes it more useful. The reverse of this does not hold true however. As we moved from the old models to new ones we realized that the usefulness moves up with no effect on the ease of use. So, ease of use has an influence on usefulness but usefulness does not influence the ease of use. Researchers aimed at a better understanding of how to choose among the wide range of possibilities offered by information technology those specific design elements that will contribute towards more user acceptance and performance (GGoslar, 1986; Klien &amp; Beck, 1987; Reimann &amp; Waren, 1985). The motivational variables of technology acceptance model: attitude towards usage, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, totally contributed the effect of design elements of information systems on usage.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="268" page="33" column="1">Usability does not always mean easy to use. It is in fact a simplification of the issue and fails to provide enough understanding for the user interface designer. Some of the major characteristics of usability for information systems/ information technology have been found to be effectiveness, efficiency, engaging power, error tolerance and easy to learn and understand. The usability of information systems can be attributed to many different factors. These factors can include just the usability of the software in terms of its results. It can also be a user-centred design. The usability of an information system can be found out by discovering how and why people use that product. The reason could be a good interaction design or its ability to understand and meet user‘s goals. Evaluation is extremely important in order to find out the usability of a system. It cannot be trusted just because of the experience or knowledge of the designer. Through carefully observing users use that product, a lot of improvement areas in the product can be figured out. The design of a system can be considered as a user- centred design only if it meets the aims, requirements and mental models of users. The definition of usability in the ISO 9241 standard is: usability is the extent to which a product helps in achieving set goals and is efficient, effective and satisfies the user in terms of its use ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35" id="241" class="deo:Reference">ISO, 1998</xref>).<marker type="block"/> Organizations can be regarded as information systems because for those signs and information is of extreme importance and the behaviors of people can be judged through social and organizational norms (Stamper el al. 1988, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43" id="243" class="deo:Reference">Liu 2000</xref>). The major issue that is of importance to organizations is how organizations can perform their business functions<marker type="page" number="34"/><marker type="block"/> effectively and how IT can help them in achieving their business objectives. The technologies like computers that expand a person‘s ability by using in businesses are called affordance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75" id="246" class="deo:Reference">Stamper, 2001</xref>, p145). That system is considered to be the most effective that enhances the ability of an organization and supports its processes.<marker type="block"/> For the evaluation of usability of information systems, it is extremely important to understand the usability goals. The above figures illustrate some of the most important characteristics on the basis of which usability of information systems can be evaluated. The significance of an information system can be judged by two major factors: its usability and its ability to be a user-centred design. The user requirements for a system should be understood before hand by the designer. The designers need to think beyond just the ease of use and be more practical while designing. This will help in making products more usable and user-friendly. The quality of an information system is dependent on its usability and it can be considered as a significant part of an information system. That is why it is extremely important to measure the usability characteristic of any information system with respect to the business in which it is being used. This will help in defining the quality of the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R73" id="250" class="deo:Reference">Ruti, 2009</xref>).<marker type="block"/> Usually a lot of difference is seen by people in IS, computers and business functions. Although information systems have a little content of information and communication technology, but it is not directly linked with ICT. There is a distinction between information systems and business functions. Information systems help in controlling the performance of business functions (O'<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64" id="252" class="deo:Reference">Brien, J A, 2003</xref>).<marker type="page" number="35"/><marker type="block"/> According to Alter, information systems are extraordinary systems that help in working. It is a kind of a system in which humans make use of systems to work for producing certain products or services for its customers. So it can be said to be a kind of system that help to capture, store, retrieve and manipulate information (Alter, S.).<marker type="block"/> They help in activities related to data and communication. It functions as a type of social memory. It helps in supporting decisions of humans and then helps them in taking action accordingly. The field of informatics deals with the study of these systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8" id="256" class="deo:Reference">Beynon, 2009</xref>).<marker type="block"/>  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45" id="262" class="deo:Reference">Nielsen (1993)</xref> says that it is important to understand that usability is not a single, one- dimensional characteristic of a computer user interface.<marker type="block"/> A major hurdle in the success of information systems has always been the lack of acceptance by users (Gould, Boies &amp; Lewis, 1991; McCarroll, 1991; Nickerson, 1981). The purpose of using information systems in most of the organizations has always been to encourage improvement of performance on the job. But the impact of performance is lost when users reject the information systems. Therefore it can be said that the success or failure of an information system is determined by user acceptance which is the major factor. Technology acceptance model has been used over the years for addressing the reason of acceptance or rejection of information systems by users and how the characteristics of the system lead to acceptance or rejection decisions by users. The features of the information systems‘ design have an effect on the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. These characteristics have a less direct impact on the attitudes towards usage and the actual usage behaviour.<marker type="page" number="36"/><marker type="block"/> For creation of successful information systems the cooperation between designers, developers, experts and users is highly important. Usually a lack of common terminology of exchanging ideas exists between them (Al &amp; Soc, 2001). The studies conducted on user- centred designs have suggested that the involvement of users in the development of information systems has a positive relation to users‘ view of the usefulness of the system (Amoako-Gyampah and White, 1993, Baroudi et al., 1986). However, it has not always been the case. It is not important that only user involvement leads to success of the system. The employment of a user-centred design system has always been found to be important because of ease of learning and use and investigation of system purpose for support of interactive learning. But it was found out through various researches that the use of user-centred method was not sufficient in producing an appropriate outcome.</region>

          <h2 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="269" page="36" column="1">3.6 Cognitive psychology</h2>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="283" page="36" column="1">Cognitive psychology involves the study of human mind and all the processes that go on inside the human mind. It tries to understand what shapes human behaviour. Language, perception and thought processes are important parts of it. Most of how people view this world and their understanding of things is based on their everyday experiences. The process of co-design is highly linked to this concept and designers have realized the importance of this concept. In the process of co-design, designers and users, in short all the participants in the team interact and coordinate with each other. They adapt to each other‘s understanding, knowledge and ideas. The mental models of all participants diverge or converge with each other which lead to an understanding and better problem solving in the process of co-design. The performance of individuals in a team and their learning process is improved as a result of sharing their knowledge and understanding, which is a result of good coordination among <marker type="page" number="37"/><marker type="block"/> team members. The efficiency of system that is designed can be attributed to a better understanding and coordination among team members. Mental models of individuals can be used in a number of ways (Johnson-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41" id="272" class="deo:Reference">Laird, 1983</xref>; Gentner &amp; Stevens, 1983).<marker type="block"/> Abel et al. (1998) acknowledged that the concept of cognitive mapping arose from cognitive studies. A cognitive map can be recognized as a spatial mental model. It is a process of acquiring, storing, coding and recalling information regarding things. It helps in reasoning and improves the ability of prediction. It increases an individual‘s ability to make generalizations based on past experiences and he makes use of those generalizations in other similar situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11" id="274" class="deo:Reference">Downs, 1976</xref>).<marker type="block"/> This term was introduced in 1967 in America, by a psychologist named psychologist Ulric Neisser. He introduced this concept in his book "Cognitive Psychology". According to him it involves the processes through which input from the brain is transferred, stored and used. Cognitive Psychology says that how people act, there is a need to understand their internal mental processes.<marker type="block"/> Cognition‘s literal meaning ―knows‖. It is basically a process through which knowledge is obtained. It is the study that focuses on information processes that g on inside human‘s brain. The psychologists take interest in the things that go on between the process of inputs and outputs. This field of psychology deals with insight, thought, language, remembrance and thinking. With the introduction of computers, this term was given a meaning and investigation of human brain. It was due to the use of computers that the complications of cognition were better understood. This was done by comparison and better understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51" id="277" class="deo:Reference">McLeod, 2007</xref>).<marker type="block"/> It also includes social and cultural factors. The study of cognitive psychology has led to building of expert systems and software. It has led to development of such systems that work together with humans and help them in meeting their information needs. It has also helped in developing a flexible information and communications structure that is based on knowledge and reasoning. Most of the tasks that were supposed to be performed by humans can now be performed with these systems that are developed with the help and understanding of the field of cognitive psychology.<marker type="block"/> A lot of people do not relate psychology to their idea of technology. At Microsoft, psychology has been found to make significant contributions to the development of software‘s as well as people in various areas and groups in the organization. Many psychologists have been directly involved in the process of product development. Mary Czerwinski has been involved in the user interface technologies. She has found out her background in psychology to be not so valuable in the exploration of the relationship between user and information technology that she works with. Leah Kaufmann, a cognitive psychologist has conducted usability studies on at least 30 different products and has found out that her training in psychology has been extremely important. Each and everything related to design of any system or software according to her requires a test to be done. She has made use of the cognitive psychology research in explaining the flaws in a particular design.<marker type="page" number="38"/><marker type="block"/> Information processing and cognitive psychology are highly linked. Cognitive psychology views humans as processors of information. It makes comparison of the human mind and computer. It considers individuals as human processors and thinks that it is possible to study the internal processes of humans. The development of computer systems has made an impact on psychology and is responsible for the importance of cognitive approach in psychology. Computers basically gave cognitive psychologists something by which they could make comparison of the human mental processing. Computer analogy is the using computer as a tool for understanding how human brain handles information. This idea of processing information by minds was developed and adopted by cognitive psychologists modeling the way human thoughts work. The human eye receives visual information and then coding of this information takes place into the neural activity inside the brain. This in turn results in feedback to brain where storing and coding of the information takes place. The other parts of brain related to activities like attention, perception and memory can also make use of this information. Hence, the information processing approach considers thinking as environment that provides input of information that is transferred later. This information can be used for storing, retrieving, and transforming through making use of mental programs which result in behavioral responses. One major assumption of the information processing approach includes that information processing in humans is similar to that in computers. Some of the major models of attention in information processing include Broadbent's Filter Model (1958), Treisman's Attenuation Model (1964) and Deutsch and Deutsch's Late Selection Model (1963). (Saul, 2008)<marker type="block"/> The mental model theory is an effort to modelling and explaining human understanding of objects and phenomenon during learning and other related activities. The research on mental models in human system interaction can be used in identifying the major elements of cognitive processes and help in developing research focused guidelines for designing systems that are interactive and also contribute to the learning process of individuals (Hueyching J., 1991). A study by Edwards, Bryan D.; Day, Eric Anthony; Arthur Jr., Winfred; Bell, Suzanne T. (2006) examined the relation between similarity and accuracy of team mental models and also led to the comparison of the limit to which each of them helped in predicting the team performance. The similarity and accuracy of team mental models besides being highly related, accuracy has been found to be a much better predictor of team performance. Team ability was even more related to accuracy than to the similarity of team mental models. Accuracy was found to be somewhere between team ability and performance but not similarity. Researchers have suggested that shared mental models among the individuals in a team help in making successful decisions.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="309" page="38" column="1">As a result of diverse interpretation and understanding, the design team faces a lot of challenges related to communication ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33" id="285" class="deo:Reference">Huang and Truth, 2007</xref>). This might also cause delay in the whole design process. The process of developing products or services through process of<marker type="page" number="39"/><marker type="block"/> co-design is communication-intensive. It also helps in removing ambiguity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12" id="288" class="deo:Reference">Edwards and Sridhar (2006)</xref> found out that any mistakes made or any communication problems at this phase will lead to bigger issues later on. A lot of communication problems might arise during the process of co-design. One of these could be language problems. This will have a significant impact on the development of an information system. Every participant is comfortable with different factors. Some might be better at explaining through speaking, some might be better at writing and some might have a better understanding of things by reading rather than listening.<marker type="block"/> Communication is an important activity in any organization. For substantive actions communication activity is used to pass messages from one individual to another. This leads to a successful performance of an organization through sending of inputs and receiving outputs as part of the communication process. For conducting of business and managing firms, communication is very important. Communication is important in order to achieve goals of an organization and relies on substantive actions. Communication is basically the exchange of messages, ideas and information through signs, writing, orally or actions. It requires a sender and a receiver. A successful communication process is the one in which the message of sender is successfully delivered and understood by the sender (Kecheng, Liu &amp; Lily Sun, 2002). Feedback is also an important part of a communication process. There are a lot of factors that affect the effectiveness of communication. These factors can include the environment of the organization where it takes place, characteristics of sender or receiver etc. The relation between sender and receiver can also affect the communication process. Factors like these cause problems in the process of communication. The ideas generated by the sender are the result of his thoughts and knowledge and understanding of things. The ideas can also<marker type="page" number="40"/><marker type="block"/> come from anything in the environment. Factors like status difference between sender and receiver can also affect the process of communication to a great extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80" id="295" class="deo:Reference">Satir, 1967</xref>).<marker type="block"/> The development of information systems for organization involves a lot of people from different backgrounds. Each member is competent and cooperates with the other to come up with innovative ideas. Each member defines the requirements through his description of the system. The reasons why problems are experienced in most of the systems are the result of misunderstanding between the participants. It is extremely important to investigate the possible misunderstandings that might occur between the participants in co-design process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46" id="297" class="deo:Reference">Laurie &amp; Stephen, 2011</xref>).<marker type="block"/>  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31" id="299" class="deo:Reference">Hofstede (1982)</xref> define culture as common characteristic which differentiates the members of one group from another. This concept can be applied to individuals in organizations as well as organizational teams. This can however prove to be beneficial in the process of co-design, because it helps in promotion of creativity and innovation. One of the disadvantages that it might have is the influence of different cultures on the relationships between participants in the team as each individual has a different set of beliefs, perceptions, attitudes and behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47" id="300" class="deo:Reference">Mullins, 2007</xref>).<marker type="block"/> Herzberg argued, communication, (with training), is one of the keys to successful motivation of employees. If employees are involved in decision making within the business, they become involved in the future success of the business (David &amp; Harris, 1998). Also key aspects of becoming a world class business, and implementing operations management methods such as just-in-time or Kaizen, depend upon the involvement and commitment of the work force. This involvement can be gained and maintained through communication (Colin, 2007). The first stage in gaining this commitment has to be the passing of information, such as the aims and objectives of the business. Once these aims and objectives are understood by all levels within the hierarchy, then operations management systems need to be put in place, that allow involvement of workers in achieving these aims.<marker type="block"/> Communication is an important part of any organization and it becomes even more important when a team or a task force are working on something. It is only through efficient system of communication and interaction among team members that relevant information is gathered for problem solving. The more the team members share their knowledge and understanding of a problem, the more innovative approaches to problem solving are recognized. The mental models of individual team members restrict them from thinking and acing in certain ways because their behaviours, views and understanding of things are shaped according to their experiences. Every individual in a team would have different mental models and some of them will be accurate for that particular task or problem and some might be inappropriate. In this situation where a team is involved, it becomes necessary to have a very good communication among team members so they can coordinate and understand each other, share their visions and creativity. The mental models of team members should adapt to each other but at the same time the diversity in views has its own benefits. With better communication and openness to criticism and new approaches, the efficiency can be<marker type="page" number="41"/><marker type="block"/> improved. In the different approaches to organizational communication teams are used mostly in top-down approach. In order to solve problems effectively, grab the best opportunities, achieve set goals, communication is essential and questions need to be answered need managers. They are the ones who are responsible for the organization (J. F., 2008).<marker type="block"/> By using appropriate ways the communication and interaction between user and designer can be enhanced during the time when user is involved in the design process. There is a need for direct contact between user and designer at the initial stages of design process. This leads to innovation and better problem solving or development of product or service. (Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995) argue that the major use of involving users in product development is to help create a better understanding of the user‘s needs and also helps in accessing users knowledge. Designers are now encouraging user‘s involvement during initial stages of design process in order to create a better understanding of their tacit knowledge and underlying needs. There is no guarantee that the direct contact with users will help in gaining the required benefits and knowledge. Sometimes that information is generated that do not help in product development. There is still a need to develop better processes, tools and guidelines to enhance communication between designers and users in design process. This will lead to better designs and help the user with the use of systems. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83" id="306" class="deo:Reference">Wright, 2006</xref>) argued that collaboration can prove to b an effective strategy in order to find innovative solutions to complicated problems. According to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14" id="307" class="deo:Reference">Carlile, 2002</xref>), the enhancement in productivity is the result of overlapping and of knowledge and ideas. As a result of collaboration between users and designers problem solving activities can be enhanced. According to these authors, user designer collaboration can prove to be more effective if this process is understood in a better way. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20" id="308" class="deo:Reference">Norman, 2005</xref>) argues that understanding the user is not always the best. Sometimes it is best to ignore them. According to (Scaif, Rogers, Aldrich, and Davies, 1997) users cannot be designers and the designs created by them are not as good as the ones created by designers who are professionals. The reason for that is sometimes users are not able to communicate or identify their needs to themselves (Pekkola, Kaarilahti, and Pohjola, 2006). Usually what happens is that the contribution made by users is too less or not as quick as required (Scaif et al., 1997). They have presented a more pessimistic view to relationship between designers and users. Literature shows that the reason for involving users during initial stages of development process includes: empowering participants, efficiency and better acceptance (Damodaran, L., 1996).</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="329" page="42" column="1">Organizational efficiency is the attainment of desired results with the minimum amount of resources, input, time and money. Specially for reducing the time and money in any organization, the best approach is to use teams that help in designing products or services and help in problem solving. Here, the concept of creative synergy also comes in. The more the mental models of different individuals coordinate and adapt to each other, the more is the creative synergy. Sometimes just the interaction of two contradicting mental models can contribute greatly to problem solving. The better the company utilizes its employees, the better it manages its teams and the more the diversity is in the teams, there is a greater chance that efficiency will increase. (Rumble, 1986) <marker type="block"/> In today‘s world, information technology is what most companies use to reach high standards and become more efficient in their business operations. Companies are spending a lot on information technology and insist that helps in increasing organizational efficiency. IT plays a significant role in not only increasing efficiency but also helps businesses in achieving a competitive advantage. Not much study has been done in the field of information technology investment and its effects on strategic performance of organizations. That is the reason why companies have to think a lot about making decisions whether to invest in it or not and how much to invest. Information technology can be linked to efficiency, inefficiency, and an organization‘s strategic and financial performance. The distinction between companies that have proved to be efficient and the ones that have proved to be inefficient, indicate the effect technology had on their efficiency. The companies that have proved to be efficient have been<marker type="page" number="43"/><marker type="block"/> found to be spending more on IT as compared to the ones who are not efficient (Mahmood, M. A., 1994).<marker type="block"/> Organizational efficiency is an indicator of how well the company has succeeded in utilizing its resources. It can be measured as a relation between effectiveness and expenditure. Some public organizations define organizational efficiency as the ability of an organization to increases its profit level through the use of equity and debt. Organizational efficiency can be attributed to a large number of factors. Every organization will define it differently. For some organization organizational efficiency is dependent a lot on its use of information technology. Information systems of some organizations help in achieving efficiency. It is also important for organization to monitor their organizational efficiency so any loss is prevented Gish, 2012). Mental models play a significant role in shaping behaviours, so the content is of great significance and has a huge impact on the effectiveness of team.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50" id="320" class="deo:Reference">Mcshane, 2006</xref>) thinks that the longer the time that team members work together, the easier it is for them to develop common mental models, understanding and effective performance.<marker type="block"/> That is the reason why design of systems is important to organizations yearning to achieve efficiency. The process of co-design is what shapes the design of the product or service. It is extremely important to understand the concept of mental models for co-design. The creative synergy as a result of different mental models of designers in a team leads to development of such efficient systems. The better the company utilizes its employees, the better it manages its teams and the more the diversity is in the teams, there is a greater chance that efficiency will increase. (Rumble, 1986)<marker type="block"/> Only if the co-design process is efficient, it will lead to a better design which would eventually enhance the efficiency of organization and its business operations. Organizational efficiency is the extent to which an organization produces a certain level of output with very few resources used.

Researchers have also highlighted the need to bring this vast and rich stream of studies inside a contingency framework considering the internal characteristics of a firm as well.

          <h2 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="330" page="44" column="1">3.9 Co-design</h2>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="352" page="44" column="1">A good definition of co-design is found in the works of W. R. Penuel, J. Roschelle &amp; N. Shechtman. They define co-design as a highly facilitated, team-based process in which teachers, researchers, and developers work together in defined roles to design an educational innovation, realize the design in one or more prototypes, and evaluate each prototype‘s significance for addressing a concrete educational need. Although there are significant roles for teachers as participants in co-design, it is not a fully democratic process. Instead, accountability and ultimate responsibility for decision making rests with the project leaders, who are ultimately responsible for the quality of the educational resource being produced. In this section, we describe seven characteristic features of co-design as a method. Co-design takes on a concrete, tangible innovation challenge. <marker type="block"/> Co-design is a concept and approach to design that involves the end users of the designed product or service. This is done to investigate whether the needs and wants of the user are being served to, and if they are not, what should be changed to achieve a more satisfactory situation. ―They enable immersion, dialogue and empathy; we start to understand the design from the point of view of the participants. The outputs are sources of both inspiration and information for designers and participants to work with in visioning future designs. They are<marker type="page" number="45"/><marker type="block"/> information gathering and design generating activities, blurring the boundaries of research and design‖ (Sanders 2008).<marker type="block"/> Co-design can only be considered successful when a critical task is completed by team and tall the requirements are met. ―In documenting practice through fieldwork, ―taking stock‖ in co-design has many similarities to rapid ethnographic techniques that are used in the design of workplace technologies (Hughes, King, Rodden &amp; Andersen, 1995; Millen, 2000).‖<marker type="block"/> But,  ̳people are not explicit sources of information‘ (Greenbaum and Madsen 1993). Getting this king of information from is rather difficult because the ways of expression are quite limited. Most of the people know no other way to express in, other than their most used language. Religion, dreams, goals, attitudes, habits or rituals are few of the things which are really hard to explain in a quantifiable manner as the individual might not even be aware of them. The goal of the entire activity is to discover and understand the participants and their requirements. To understand an individual, not any one specific are can be targeted. In order to get a complete set of information, a large number of questions are placed to understand a participant. These questions may target areas such as relationships, fears, dreams, places, thoughts, attitudes, activities, frustrations, priorities and or motivations. The list is not limited to just these points. But,  ̳people are not explicit sources of information‘ (Greenbaum and Madsen 1993). Getting this kind of information from people is rather difficult because the ways of expression are quite limited. Most of the people know no other way to express in, other than their most used language. Religion, dreams, goals, attitudes, habits or rituals are few of the things which are really hard to explain in a quantifiable manner as the individual might not even be aware of them.<marker type="block"/> To eliminate this problem we retreat to a generative‘ design research method. This helps make things that are normally unobservable available as resources for design.<marker type="block"/> According to Sleeswijk Visser(2009)  ̳while techniques like interviews and observations provide us access to the open and visible, generative techniques permit us the accesses to the implicit and understood features of lives of people. Sleeswijk Visser argues that generative techniques are planned to, ―permit us to get access to a concealed user experience world‖.<marker type="block"/> Co-design begins with a goal of creating some kind of innovation that seeks to advance an educational goal. In this respect, co-design is closely related to participatory design in that it is always oriented toward the development of a specific sociotechnical system — that is, a set of technologies and social activities in which the technologies. (W. R. Penuel, J. Roschelle &amp; N. Shechtman, 2007)<marker type="block"/> Co-design is a development of systems thinking, which according to C. West Churchman "begins when first you view the world through the eyes of another." Co-design is described as a process that allows customers to express their product requirements and carry out product realization processes by mapping the requirements into the physical domain of the product<marker type="page" number="46"/><marker type="block"/> (Khalid &amp; Helander, 2003; von Hippel, 1998). This leads to the customer choosing a personalized combination of product from an infinite set of options. During this entire process, the customer is made a part of the value creation of the supplier. The customer becomes a co-producer or "prosumer" (Toffler, 1980). This is the knowledge created and utilized by those making use o technology. It is something very essential that should be understood that it is difficult to formalize this kind of knowledge. The theory of cognition usually does not give much importance to it and leads interaction between computers and human beings (Winograd and Flores 1986; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57" id="342" class="deo:Reference">Nardi 1996</xref>; Nardi and Engestrom; 1999). Co- design has a lot of benefits and is also considered to have a lot of significance. The three basic benefits that it can provide include benefits for the design process, benefits for the customer or user and benefits to the organization. It helps not only in the improvement of the creative design process but also the performance of the product or service being designed. There are a lot of long term benefits too that it can provide.<marker type="block"/> Co-design begins with a goal of creating some kind of innovation that seeks to advance an educational goal. In this respect, co-design is closely related to participatory design inthat it is always oriented toward the development of a specific sociotechnical system — that is, a set of technologies and social activities in which the technologies (W. R. Penuel, J. Roschelle &amp; N. Shechtman, 2007).Co-design can only be considered successful when a critical task is completed by team and tall the requirements are met. ―In documenting practice through fieldwork, ―taking stock‖ in co-design has many similarities to rapid ethnographic techniques that are used in the design of workplace technologies (Hughes, King, Rodden &amp; Andersen, 1995; Millen, 2000).‖<marker type="page" number="47"/><marker type="block"/> The process of co-design involves the process of participatory idea generation. Co-design is considered to be better than just design. The reason for that is that groups of creative and innovative individuals have a better capability of building successful products and services as a result of different point of views, rather than just depending upon the knowledge, skills, understanding and creativity of one individual. Co-design is basically creation through participation of different stakeholders in many coordinated activities, which help in generation of ideas and development of solutions. The participation of different individuals helps in giving a boost to potential, generating consensus and decreasing the innovation risk. Each individual has different views and the designer has to make sure that every view is considered and integrated and combined well. It is the age of collaborative development and innovation. Therefore, while designing a product or service, with the help of collaboration between different individuals the end customer gets closer and hence a solution is developed that gives a better and more realistic response to needs. Through modeling the needs, generation of ideas and development of solutions between user and design teams, not only can technology be challenged but also organizations become way more open. In the end it is the users who are going to get benefit from the solution therefore they should be the major players in the design process. The explanation of needs is given for making problems clearer and understandable and creatively focusing the group. The knowledge on which actions can be taken is the centre of participatory idea generation. During the explanation phase a model of needs is developed that also defines the problems that are to be solved. In the generation phase, ideas are generated and categorized in a participatory focused environment. In the definition phase, the solutions are structured in a participatory manner. Through involving the different stakeholders, all encompassing solutions will be defined. Co-design is extremely beneficial for organizations that that already possess information on which actions can be taken and this information is regarding the needs of people that are supposed to be reached. It is also for the organizations that want to generate ideas and high innovative potential and<marker type="page" number="48"/><marker type="block"/> value and for organizations that need to combine and manage many ideas from inside and outside the organization.

          <h2 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="353" page="48" column="1">3.10 Interaction design</h2>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="368" page="48" column="1">̳ ̳In the coming 50 years, the growing significance of designing spaces for human communication and relations will cause development in those features of computing which are emphasized on people, in spite of machinery. ... The work will be entrenched in disciplines which emphasize on people and communication, like psychology, communications, linguistics, and graphic design and in the disciplines which encourage computing and communications technology. ... Effective communication design needs a change from observing the machinery to observing the people lives by means of it‘‘ (Winograd, 1997). <marker type="block"/> Usually the information system design occurs with only one assumption that the user is going to be entirely focused on interacting with the system that is being designed.  ̳In creating tools we are designing new conversations and connections‘‘ (Winograd and Flores, 1986).<marker type="block"/> The above figure illustrates that when a new interaction is designed it does not exist in isolation but is placed within a pre-existing interaction space. The other interactions that are already present in the space affect the new interaction in a wide variety of ways. If you ignore<marker type="page" number="49"/><marker type="block"/> them during the process of designing, the consequences can be really bad after the implementation of new interaction.<marker type="block"/> The information and interaction design is the meeting of the disciplines of information design, sensorial design and interaction design. Information design is related to graphic and publishing designing. It is still not greatly practiced in these two fields. Information design is basically the representation of organization data. It deals with how it can be transformed into information that is valuable and holds significant meaning. Creating this information is what everyone practices to some extent. It has just been identified as a separate discipline which has some proper processes that can be used and taught. There are not many resources available to learn about the practices of information and interaction design. Interaction design can be put in easy words as story creation or storytelling. This has always been done through the use of media and helps in creating experiences. The new facilities offered by media involve such opportunities that have not been used earlier in interaction. The major issue is that people fail to understand the demand for interactivity. There is a need to understand how the skills should be expressed through use of interactive technology and what audiences demand and what interests them (Nathan, 1989).<marker type="block"/> Some of the major principles of interaction design include anticipation, autonomy, color blindness, consistency, defaults, efficiency of the user, explorable interfaces, Fitt‘s law, human interface objects, latency reduction, learnability, readability; protect users' work and visible navigation. The application must be helpful is anticipating the needs and wants of the users. It should not be expected that the users will search or collect information or suggest the<marker type="page" number="50"/><marker type="block"/> important tools. All the tools and information that are required should be brought to the users which are helpful at every stage of the process. Whenever colors are used for conveying information, cues should also be used in addition to it and these cues should be very clear so that they are able to convey information to those individuals who are unable to experience any color coding. The color displays are common but not universal even today. It has been found out that a lot of people these days have color blindness too. It is important to maintain a certain level of consistency but the level of its importance varies. Inconsistency is also very important and sometimes it is required that things act differently. It is also important to avoid uniformity. The objects must be consistent with their behavior. The objects that act differently must be made to look differently. The importance of consistency is the most when it comes to users‘ expectations. The best way of assuring that is to do user testing. It is important to look at the productivity of users and not the computers because computers are made for users. The cost of people is far more than of computers so the productivity of machines should result in productivity of individuals, the opposite of this is also quite true. Therefore, whenever a system is judged for its efficiency it is important to look just beyond the efficiency of the machine. It is also important that it keeps the user occupied. The highest cost in any business is the cost of labor. Therefore, every time a user waits for the system to respond, money of the organization is being wasted. So in order to maximize the efficiency, efficiency of everyone in the organization should be maximized and not just that of a single group.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="382" page="50" column="1">It is extremely important to understand how IT affects businesses. The organizations and managers concern while investing in IT is also an important issue. IT helps organizations in improving their performance and meeting their goals. It also helps individuals in similar ways. In certain situations it costs a lot more to manage it and fewer benefits are given by it. Different IT applications for businesses include CRM, ERP and e-business solutions ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40" id="370" class="deo:Reference">Jonas &amp; Thomas, 2002</xref>).<marker type="block"/> According to Chesbrough and Rosenbloom (2002), the business model for an organization dealing with technology arbitrates the value creation process between the technical and economic domains. It selects and filters technology and packages it to offer to the market. . In this value creation process between the technical and economic domains there are strong echoes of the concepts of  ̳economic competence‘ (Carlsson and Stankiewicz 1991; Carlsson and Eliasson 1994) and  ̳competence bloc‘ (Eliasson 2000) both of which emphasise the need for firms to take advantage of their business opportunities arising from innovation to effect economic change. Many researchers have stressed on the use of IT in the improvement of strategic performance of a business. One of the major opportunities that result from use of information technology includes improving organizations efficiency and effectiveness (Yannis &amp; Micheal, 1986).<marker type="page" number="51"/><marker type="block"/> According to Porter, the technology development is a support activity. It can be used in any stage of the value chain process and helps in lowering costs of outbound logistics with the help of a better and improved management. The concept of the role of technology is more applicable to established organizations in which technology development is exogenous to the primary activities. In case of organizations whose main purpose is innovation, there technology development cannot be considered to be a support activity. For such organizations, it is an essential part of their business operations and all its performance needs to be viewed as a primary activity.<marker type="block"/> Some of the ways in which an organization can obtain competitive advantage through use of IT include reduction of costs, improving quality and added differentiation. IT can be used by organizations n a variety of different ways. Organizations can use it to perform their tasks effectively and efficiently. It can be used for customers, employees, suppliers, factory automation, strategic and partnership planning. IT is now being considered as a resource for an organization. That is the reason it has started to gain the attention of managers. The importance of IT can be attributed to four major forces: globalization, competition, organizational changes and its ability to enhance performance and being affordable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36" id="378" class="deo:Reference">Jagdish, 1994</xref>). There is still a lot to understand regarding the influence of information technology on an organization and the results an organization can achieve through proper coordination of technology, operations and business strategy. Information technology has a strong link with the corporate strategy. Companies have started focusing more on information technology for achieving competitive advantage. Basically the wave of information technology is the result of unstable economic conditions of the past few years. Also it helps in achieving a lot of advantages at an exceptionally lower cost. However, a major problem being faced in the case of IT is its underutilization. This problem is faced not only by information systems but also by managers. The reason for this problem is that the uses of IT are often overlooked; there is also a lack of proper communication between information system managers and the business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9" id="379" class="deo:Reference">Benjamin &amp; Wyman, 1984</xref>). There has also been observed some resistance among<marker type="page" number="52"/><marker type="block"/> organizations to move towards change. Also there is a lack of any measuring tools for measuring the benefits that IT serves to organizations. The reason for the focus of information technology in businesses include overcoming organizational weaknesses that decrease it efficiency.</region>

          <h2 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="383" page="52" column="1">3.12 Summary of theoretical findings</h2>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="394" page="52" column="1">The results of theoretical study are presented below. They are presented with respect to each sub-question. <marker type="block"/> Theory has suggested that the significance of an information system is related strongly to its usability. Usability can not only be judged by how well the system performs or its ease of use. The usability of a system is different for every business according to its needs and the goals it wants to achieve by use of that system. Some of the major characteristics identified for usability include efficiency and its easy learning. Ease of learning is what is extremely important to businesses. Although the first and foremost purpose of an information system for an organization is its ability to support its business operations, the company cannot benefit from kits use unless its workers are able to learn how to use it. It should therefore be such that the employees do not have to take too much time to learn it because it would result in a lot of wastage of time on their training. The basic characteristics of usability are usually the basic ones for every business. The use and aim of employing a particular system might be different for every organization. Another very important characteristic of usability discovered as a result of theoretical studies includes its efficiency. An information system needs to be efficient enough if it wants to contribute towards organizational efficiency.<marker type="block"/> The usability of co-design can best be enhanced by involving users in co-design process. Only a user can tell what characteristics he looks for when using a particular product. The more the user is able to communicate his needs, wants and experiences with technology to the designers the better will the design or system turn out to be. Observing users use the designed system can also help a lot in understanding their problems and needs. But that would mean changes in the designed system. That is the reason why involvement of users during initial stages of design process holds so much significance. (Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995) argue that the major use of involving users in product development is to help create a better understanding of the user‘s needs and also helps in accessing users knowledge. That is the reason why designers are now encouraging users‘ involvement during initial stages of design process in order to create a better understanding of their tacit knowledge and underlying needs.<marker type="page" number="53"/><marker type="block"/> Theory has suggested that the mental models of participants mean a lot for the process of so- design. Every individual has his own set of knowledge and ideas. Some individuals possess more knowledge about a certain subject and some about others. Therefore it can be observed during the process of co-design that some participants will have more knowledge and understanding of the problems than other. There might be some participants who will be more creative. The thinking of an individual might be restricted as a result of his/her mental model. Mental models restrict the thinking of individuals according to their knowledge and experiences. So when the mental models or participants interact with each other, this leads to a better and more efficient design. The better the design is, the better will be for the business. Since IT contributes towards efficiency or an organization, so it is extremely important that the information system designed for the business is also efficient enough. Theory has provided some important explanations related to the mental model variables and the success of the information system. The characteristics of each participant also hold a lot of significance. Along with their mental models, their experiences, knowledge, level of understanding and each other‘s acceptability of ideas also counts. As a result of diversity in a team involved in co-design, innovation and creativity result. Mental models play a significant role in shaping behaviours, so the content is of great significance and has a huge impact on the effectiveness of team.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50" id="391" class="deo:Reference">Mcshane, 2006</xref>) thinks that the longer the time that team members work together, the easier it is for them to develop common mental models, understanding and effective performance.<marker type="block"/> Misunderstandings between designers and users during co-design are the reason that causes problems in use of systems later on. Sometimes the user is unable to communicate well about the needs and knowledge he possesses about technology. These days, most businesses have intercultural environments. People from different backgrounds and cultures bring diversity to organizations but at the same time create problems. The problems can be regarding their relations with each other or in simple communication of ideas. One of the major communication problems acting to theory that has been studied is of language. Sometimes major misunderstandings are the result of language. Also, the acceptance of each other‘s culture is an issue. It is really important that communication is enhanced between participants in co-design. Any misunderstandings lead to an adverse affect on design of system. It should therefore be made sure that the participants are open to new ideas and criticism. They communicate in a matter that no misunderstandings result. The use of a set language for everyone would help greatly in reducing most of the communication problems.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="397" page="54" column="1">Empirical study will help not only in creating a better understanding by presentation of practical research but also help in clearing any doubts. Theory has revealed that a better communication between designer and user will affect the usability of the designed system. The better understanding is the result of involvement of user during initial stages and by making sure factors like language and cultural diversity are kept in mind and handles well. Theory has also suggested that the involvement of user in design process sometimes does not serve any good because he is not a professional in the field and sometimes fails to understand his needs well. In order to remove any ambiguity of this sort, empirical research will be used. In order to provide a better argument as compared to literature review, the empirical study will be carried out. The themes identified in theory will better be confirmed by empirical results of this research. The empirical study will be carried out by interviews in the selected organization.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="401" page="55" column="1">The empirical study will help in creating an addition to the current knowledge regarding the communication between designers and users for designed information systems. It will help in investigating the factors that would reduce the communication problems between designers and users in co-design and would help in increasing the efficiency. The theoretical study has given abundant information regarding the research topic which has helped in shaping the conceptual knowledge related to this topic. However, the communication between designers and users in co-design for IT and businesses pertains to the interaction among people who have different perceptions, interpretations and mental models that they use in their everyday life. There are times when communication between designers and users is affected by communication barriers that decrease the effectiveness. Thus the aim is to gain an insight into the determinants that encourage effective communication between designers and users in co- design.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="403" page="55" column="1">The interview sampling done for empirical study, highlight Sony Sony Ericsson, which is a Swedish telecommunications company and a global provider of mobile multimedia devices. Purposive sampling strategy has been adopted for the interviews. Considering the fact that Sony Sony Ericsson fits into the set sample frame it also fits well with the desired research objective. Sony Sony Ericsson is the chosen organization for study through the process of purposive sampling because of its ability to represent the data source population required for investigating communication problems between designers and users during process of co- design. The actual data sample selection was made through internet search where a lot of other Swedish companies were also considered. This organization was chosen for sampling because of its implications to informatics. During the elimination process several options were considered but most of them were rejected due to locality and not being very practical choices for investigation. As a result of internet search several telecommunication companies in Sweden were found and out of those Sony Sony Ericsson was chosen based on the ease of contact and locality. As a result of searching the web directory, contact information of origination‘s members was accessed, holding positions from upper to lower level management. Considering the aim was to generate data from an informant who is linked closely to the information systems use and its design informants from technology department and middle level management were selected for research.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="409" page="55" column="1">The preparations for research interview were made in advance based on the research strategy. The basic decision included selection of an organization to study, type of data that is to be <marker type="page" number="56"/><marker type="block"/> generated, how long the study is going to be, arrangement and documentation for interviews. The general interview guide is an approach that outlines all the issues that need to be explored with each informant prior to the interview. It is basically a checklist to ensure all important issues are covered in the interview. An interview guide based on questions was designed. It was linked to the interview technique. Identification of many important concepts took place. The structure of questions was decided first and then the interview questions were formulated. Based on the data generation technique it was important that informants express all their experiences and perceptions about the research topic. An important part of an interview involves pre arrangement of an interview; the informants are contacted regarding discussion about the data, timing and place for the interview.<marker type="block"/> The theoretical study helped in identification of certain concepts that were related strongly to the sub questions of research. These concepts formed a basis for the formulation of interview questions in interview guide. Initially the interview questions were approximately 30 but after proper evaluation based on their relevancy to research topic a few were excluded. The relevance was decided based on the effectiveness to collect important data from informants regarding communication problems and barriers, co-design process, use of IT in facilitating business processes, information systems and mental models of designers and users. The interview questions in the interview guide were first tested on friends and class fellows to check if any questions can be misinterpreted, were not relevant or required corrections because of inappropriate sentence structures. The questions were open-ended which provided informants the freedom to provide details and elaboration when required.<marker type="block"/> The questions were arranged in such a format that they began from the general questions and then moved towards the more focused ones. This structured helped in reducing tension and placing the informant in a relaxed state of mind helping and encouraging him/her in sharing experiences and views about topic of interest. During the process of a semi structured interview it is important that the interviewer listens carefully to each and every word and detail so that any topic or information that requires further inquiry can be taken forward. When the informants met for the interviews they were given a detailed overview of the purpose of research along with the importance of research for the organization. It was made sure that a good rapport is created with the informants who would help later in the interview. Generic conversation was started with the informant in order to develop respect and trust and for creating a comfortable environment for the interview. The documentation for the interview was done by recording. It was made sure that one question is asked at a time and responses are encouraged. An attempt was made to remain as neutral as possible. The recording was later transcribed into text. This allowed proper structuring and categorizing information according to evaluation of important points.</region>

The young innovators are honored at Sony Sony Ericsson. (www.Sony Ericsson.com)<marker type="block"/> Sony Sony Ericsson is a joint venture of Japanese company Sony Corporation and Swedish company Sony Ericsson. It was established in 2011 with its operation being carried out in all major countries. The major reason behind collaboration of Sony and Sony Ericsson was that Sony wanted to make use of Sony Ericsson‘s knowledge of technology in the field of mobile communication. Now the phones are being manufactured as well as sold under the name of Sony Sony Ericsson. Mobile music devices, wireless systems and high tech accessories are some of the other areas it deals with. The power of Sony Ericsson has expanded in market due to its share in Sony Sony Ericsson.<marker type="block"/> The success of any organization is dependent on the knowledge it maintains and uses with the help of its employees, customers and information systems. Utilizing and building on that knowledge is what most organizations aim to. It is a goal that demands a lot of effort. This knowledge can be left with certain people who get it with passing time and experience. This knowledge can be wasted if it is only left with those people and they leave the organization. This is where the information systems start gaining importance. Knowledge management systems and expert systems are such information systems that help in storing that knowledge. This research will help in understanding how telecom giant like Sony Sony Ericsson makes use of expert systems to monitor telecom network that would replace the efforts of a human expert. Some of the largest mobile operators on world use technologies of Sony Sony Ericsson. 40% of the mobile traffic travels through its systems.<marker type="block"/> Informant 1 manages systems and has been working at Sony Ericsson since 2000. Informant 1 illuminated the need for information systems and provided with the information of important<marker type="page" number="58"/><marker type="block"/> systems being used at Sony Ericsson. Sony Ericsson started working with an expert system company in assisting with network fault management. The company made use of real time technology in automating the process in which network alarms could be monitored and the alarms that require immediate attention and which can wait could be identified automatically. The expert individuals working at Sony Ericsson started assisting the company in designing of the system. They shared their experiences, problems and secrets related to the complex process of interpreting alarms. It was required that the expert knowledge gathered is complete and accurate and the system is executed as early as possible. There were about 500,000 alarms each day and 50 different kinds of equipment were used to send them. This expert system is now being used in 500 systems of Sony Ericsson for managing network faults. It is being used in over 100 countries now.<marker type="block"/> The informant told us about some of the best and most usable information systems being used by Sony Ericsson. ERICOMP is a new and modern information system that is used for meeting component information needs in Sony Ericsson. It is used in fields of design, purchase, production, marketing support and selection and qualification of components. This system at present stores information about eight thousand components, that can be used in design and information regarding manufacturers. This database is accessible to all Sony Ericsson units worldwide. It is an easy to use system and anyone familiar with the system can form the required operations through it. This system was modified in 1992 because there was a need to update data from a UNIX environment too. It has replaced the older information systems and has all the new information stored in it.<marker type="block"/> COMET is a system that is used for providing component information to designers of hardware. It has provided a lot of advantages through its integration in the flow of information between components and hardware design departments. It is also able to generate data engineering documents. It is a flexible system and its flexibility is apparent from the fact that additional attributes can be assigned to a component.<marker type="block"/> ELIS is a system that provides information regarding the approved suppliers of purchased items. Everyday this information is transferred to another system known as Computer Aided Purchasing system. This system provides information to Sony Ericsson purchasers when they have to place orders. The information needs that this system fulfills include providing information about supplier‘s identity, name and address, approving suppliers, kind of packaging used, coding an article and supplier, stocking, the last time of buying and alternative components.<marker type="block"/> The informant also gave us relevant information regarding the usability of information systems. Each information system was designed keeping in mind the business operations that it was supposed to support. Fortunately, the information system have been able to facilitate the business processes to a great extent and also helped in creating ease for the employees. It has helped in saving not only time but also the cost of business operations. The usability of an information system is the ease of use of the designed system and the ability of users to quickly understand and learn about it. But usability is not just about user satisfaction. It can be<marker type="page" number="59"/><marker type="block"/> defined better after a need analysis. Every system has been designed keeping in mind certain needs so the usability can better be defined keeping in mind how well those needs are fulfilled and how efficient that system is.<marker type="block"/> It has been observed that most of the information systems that did not prove to be efficient for the organization and its business processes were the ones in which the users were not closely involved in the co-design process. The systems whose design was the result of close collaboration between designer and user were the ones that proved to be most beneficial. So, according o the company‘s experience with information systems, the communication between designers and users during co-design is extremely important. The designers cannot predict the exact needs of the users and even if they do, the problems that the user might face during the use of designed system can result because of not knowing about the user‘s mental models. Sony Ericsson made sure that during the designing of systems the expert individuals and users of system took part in co-design process. The users were given time to first understood and predict their exact needs and then communicate them clearly to the designers. It was also made sure that any communication barriers like language or cultural differences between designers are either eliminated or handled well. In order to make the communication process better, the time spent between the designers and users was increased so that there is a better understanding of mental models of users and also their unspoken problems could be addressed with the design of the system. The mental models of designers are as important as the mental models of users. During the co-design process, the mental models of users served the designers with an understanding of how they might use the system and also their knowledge and understanding of the problems. The mental models of designers helped in designing of the system because there was some basic expertise lacking with the users that were provided by designers. Sometimes even the needs not identified by users were identified by designers because of their experience and knowledge. The greater the gap between mental models of participants in co-design, the better and more innovative the design of information systems tuned out to be. The major misunderstandings result from the language and cultural barriers. Sometimes the mode of exchanging information in a better way is different for designers and users. One might be able to express better by writing and the other might be able to communicate better orally. Sometimes the overconfidence of designer in his/her skills, knowledge and capabilities does not allow him/her to utilize the knowledge of users.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="436" page="59" column="1">The second interview was also taken in the same organization but the informant belonged to a different level and department. Informant 2 communicates with informant 1 regarding issues related to systems. Informant 2 gave us a clear and much better description of the needs of employees at Sony Ericsson that could not be fulfilled without the use of efficient information systems. Sony Ericsson has a very complex and busy network. It encounters a wide range of problems each day. The problems include failure of routers, transmitters and other telecom hardware devices. Every time such a problem is encountered or any such fault occurs, the dashboards alert the network administrators and then the process of testing and monitoring the <marker type="page" number="60"/><marker type="block"/> network takes place. The network administrators at Sony Ericsson face a lot of stress. There are a number of alarms everyday that that indicate network faults. Sometimes it is important to evaluate and act upon those problems immediately. Here comes the challenge for administrators in determining which alarms are most important and require immediate attention. It is not impossible but very difficult to determine which alarms can wait and which require immediate attention. It creates a lot of hassle. In such situations, the administrators can determine the importance of each alarm by reading, interpreting and analyzing its importance. But the problem is that every day there are thousands of alarms that flow in. Before one alarm could be evaluated for its importance, many others will arrive. So the time to read each alarm is not sufficient. This is the problem due to which the need for an expert system arose.<marker type="block"/> As a result of demands by Sony Ericsson‘s units all over the world, there was a need for a system that provides easy and quick access to information regarding components that have been made. The people responsible for components at Sony Ericsson will not be able to satisfy all the demands without the use of an information system. The information system will be able to provide quick and up-to-date information regarding the available components.<marker type="block"/> The major requirements that an information system needs to fulfill include : providing information regarding the approved suppliers of a component, the packaging alternatives for an article, should allow addition and deletion of components online easily, quick processing of new information and making it accessible to all parties that would be interested and providing information security.<marker type="block"/> Detailed information regarding components is required by hardware designers at Sony Ericsson if they want to succeed. This information can be regarding the characteristic of a certain component or the tasks that are supposed to be performed by it. Everyday new kinds of components are being developed and brought in the market at a very fast rate. This requires the designers to have a quick access to all component related data along with their computer based tools. The production department requires information regarding the methods that can be used for packaging, and delivery of these components. With the required information about components they will be able to order the components in a form that suits their product routine best. A system was developed that had a common database. It was accessible by everyone working at Sony Ericsson wherever in the world they are working. The current information system being used for component information to purchasers is Electronic Data Interchange. This helps in communicating with the systems of component suppliers.<marker type="block"/> The informant also told about some of the major advantages of the systems being used at Sony Ericsson. The advantage that this system has served is that those human experts now face a lot less stress and they only have to address the most important alarms. The system has helped in improving the performance and quality of networks at Sony Ericsson. The human administrators are now able to focus on problems based on priority. The corporate knowledge is also digitalized now. This will benefit the company for generations of employees to come. Even if any employee leaves the company, the danger of losing the knowledge that only he possesses has finished.<marker type="page" number="61"/><marker type="block"/> The informant told us about the department most closely associated with the information systems. Component department is most closely associated with developing and managing data in information systems. The components department at Sony Ericsson provides support for developing systems products from design stage to production stage. Its tasks include providing designers with the entire variety of components available, maintaining expert knowledge in designing and engineering fields of components, ensuring a certain level of quality in components manufacturing and in supporting designers and producers by providing all the relevant information they need.<marker type="block"/> The flexibility of database system and the ability to enter family attributes and articles any time are some of the major benefits that it serves. Future data regarding components can be entered into the system any time. It is less time consuming and also modifying programs does no cost much. The information systems also help in reducing the lead time.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="450" page="61" column="1">For preparing data for analysis, the data was divided into three categories. The first category included relevant data, the second included irrelevant data and third included general information about participants and the study. The data that was in category of relevant data is used to answer the sub questions that lead us to the answer of the main research question. <marker type="block"/> The usability of systems defined by Sony Ericsson is different and dependant on the needs of that system. How well those needs are fulfilled describes how efficient and usable that system is. Some of the major characteristics for usability that are identified by Sony Ericsson include ease of learning and ease of use. It is extremely important that the system is easy to use because if employees are unable to understand how to use it, there will be no benefit of the system. If the training is required for the system it should be provided to the employees<marker type="page" number="62"/><marker type="block"/> keeping in minds that not too much time and money is wasted in it. That is the reason why Sony Ericsson wants to make use of such systems that are easy to learn as well as ease to use.<marker type="block"/> Sony Ericsson makes sure that the systems designed are not independent of the business functions they are designed for. They should be aligned with the business goals. For understanding the exact goals that are to be achieved through use of those systems it is important to involve users in co-design process. It would give an idea of about the knowledge and mental levels of users and help in understanding how easily they will be able to understand the system and use it. If the level of understanding is low for the users, it should be made sure that any difficulties in use are eliminated right at the design phase. This would reduce problems later and also reduce the time for training.<marker type="block"/> The process can be more efficient if mental models of participants coordinate and adapt to each other and learning takes place. Some participants will be more creative than others, some would be more experienced and some might have a better knowledge of the problem area. Therefore, if diversity is observed in a team and participants mental models differ from each other it is a good thing. This would help in coming across those problems that might be left unidentified if the mental models of all participants are similar to each other. In Sony Ericsson it has been observed that the needs not identified by users sometimes were identified by designers because of their experience and knowledge. The greater the gap between mental models of participants in co-design, the better and more innovative the design of information systems turns out to be.<marker type="block"/> Diversity on one hand leads to better creativity and innovation but on the other hand causes a lot of problems for teams and organizations. The intercultural environment at Sony Ericsson often leads to a lot of communication problems. So it makes sure that any barriers to communication are eliminated and all problems are addressed well. The major aspects to be considered in order to reduce misunderstandings include more time spent between designers and users, making sure that a common language is used for communication and that is known well by users as well as designers, the users and designers should be given the freedom to express in any mode of communication that suits them. Equal authority should also be given so each participant feels empowered and contributes without hesitation of any senior authority.</region>

          <region class="unknown" id="456" page="63" column="1"> What are the characteristics for good usability?</region>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="473" page="63" column="1">According to theoretical study, the significance of an information system is strongly based on its usability which cannot be simply judged through the efficiency and ease of use of system. The usability of every system is different for every business because of the difference in needs and goals of every business. Some of the major characteristics for usability identified from theoretical study include efficiency and ease of learning. Ease of learning is considered to be the most important to businesses because it can only benefit the business if the employees are comfortable in operating the system. The basic purpose of an information system is still its ability to support the operations of a business. The ease of learning factor has also be affirmed through empirical studies which also stresses that the system should be easy to learn so not much time is wasted on training employees. Another very important characteristic of usability identified in theoretical studies includes efficiency. The efficiency of an information system leads to organizational efficiency too. <marker type="block"/> The empirical studies also enforce that the usability of a system is dependent on needs of business and the goals require to be achieved through use of that system. Ease of use and ease of learning are identified as the most important characteristics of usability according to empirical studies. There are different systems mentioned in the interview part of the study and each one of them serves different purposes of the business so each of theirs usability can be defined differently. The different systems being used at Ericson like ERICOMP, COMET and<marker type="page" number="64"/><marker type="block"/> ELIS have different purposes for which they were designed. Their usability cannot just be accessed through their ease of use. It is more important that they serve the purpose for which they were designed. COMET is a system that is used for providing component information to designers of hardware. It has provided a lot of advantages through its integration in the flow of information between components and hardware design departments. So its usability can be defined as being able to integrate flow of information between components and hardware design departments.<marker type="block"/> Usability can best be enhanced by involving users in co-design process. According to theoretical studies, a user is the only one who can identify the characteristics he/she wants in a certain system that would help him/her in performing his tasks and facilitating business operations. The better the communication between designer and user, the better will the user‘s needs, wants and experiences translated into the system. Another way of enhancing the usability identified in theoretical studies includes observation. Observing the users use the system will help in understanding the needs and problems of users but this would not be a good way because it would lead to modifications in design of system. So the best way is to identify the needs and problems of users during the co-design process with the help of close communication between designers and user. Involving the user at initial stages of design process will also help in accessing the knowledge of user. That is the reason why users need to be involved in early staged of design process so that their underlying needs can be identified and their tacit knowledge could be understood in a better way.<marker type="block"/> The empirical study suggests that the systems should be aligned with the business goals. They should not be considered independent of the business because their major purpose is facilitation of business processes. The empirical study also considers the involvement of users in co-design as a major step to enhancing usability of systems. It has been observed that most of the information systems that did not prove to be efficient for Sony Ericson and its business processes were the ones in which the users were not closely involved in the co-design process. The systems whose design was the result of close collaboration between designer and user were the ones that proved to be most beneficial. So, according o the company‘s experience with information systems, the communication between designers and users during co-design is extremely important. The designers cannot predict the exact needs of the users and even if they do, the problems that the user might face during the use of designed system can result because of not knowing about the user‘s mental models.<marker type="block"/> The theoretical study identified mental models as the most important contributors to co-design process. Every person with his own set of mental models, knowledge and ideas contributes to co-design process. There is a difference in mental models of participants usually but<marker type="page" number="65"/><marker type="block"/> sometimes they might be similar which is no very good for the efficiency of co-design process. The creativity and innovation is greater when diversity is observed in a group or when there I a gap between mental models of participants. The collaboration between designers and users and the overlapping of knowledge and ideas is what makes the process of co-design efficient. This would eventually lead to an efficient information system being designed. This better design would lead to facilitation of business processes and eventually efficiency of the organization would increase. Theoretical studies have identified information technology to be a great contributor to businesses success.<marker type="block"/> The empirical study also highlights the significance of mental models in co-design. The content of shared mental models has been found to affect the efficiency of design process. It may not be possible to develop strategies of teamwork that are equally applicable for stakeholders in co design process. But general recommendations and strategies can be applied based on specific project requirements and under the required conditions for the specific project. Sometimes the design teams need to be extremely diverse; sometimes they need to be more experienced and so on but the efficiency of design is seen to be more affected by the diversity in team members because that leads to creativity in problem solving. The more the diversity in individuals in a team, the more will be the difference in mental models of team members. The empirical study focuses on another factor learning which is important to not only organizations and its members but also the teams and co-design process. Empirical study also suggests diversity to be a great contributor to efficiency of process. The study in Sony Ericsson also helped in observing that the needs not identified by users sometimes can be identified by designers because of the diversity in teams and difference in mental models and experiences.<marker type="block"/> The theoretical studies illuminate the fact that misunderstandings between designers and users during co-design are the reason of failure of information systems. The inability of a user to communicate about his needs and wants and the knowledge he possesses leads to the design of system being difficult to use and the system itself being inefficient. Most of the businesses these days function in an intercultural environment which leads o a lot of problems despite the advantage of diversity. These problems can vary from communication to relationships between individuals. According to theory, the major communication problem observed in communication is language. The inability of individuals to accept each other‘s culture and ideas has also been identified as an issue that creates misunderstandings. The misunderstandings lead to the design of system being inefficient therefore the problems in communication need to be addressed well and as quick as possible. The use of a set language has been identified as a factor that would reduce most of the communication related problems.<marker type="block"/> The empirical study suggests some more aspects that need consideration for reducing misunderstandings in developing information systems in an inter-cultural environment. These include more time spent between designer and users, freedom and empowerment of every<marker type="page" number="66"/><marker type="block"/> participant and the ability to express in any mode of communication suitable to them like written, oral or any other. The major misunderstandings result from the language and cultural barriers. Sometimes the mode of exchanging information in a better way is different for designers and users. One might be able to express better by writing and the other might be able to communicate better orally. Sometimes the overconfidence of a designer in his/her skills, knowledge and capabilities does not allow him/her to utilize the knowledge of users.</region>

          <h2 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="474" page="66" column="1">5.2 Result summary</h2>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="475" page="66" column="1">During the research a theoretical study of existing literature was conducted and an empirical study on Sony Ericsson was conducted based on the research topic. A comparative analysis of theoretical and empirical studies was done that helped in identifying existing or emerging themes. The grounds for comparison are based on answers to sub questions that help in underpinning the main research question.</region>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="476" confidence="possible" page="66" column="1"> The analysis of sub question 1 suggests that the major characteristics of good usability are determined based on need analysis. Efficiency, ease of use and ease of learning have been identified to be the major characteristics of good usability. All these are some of the general characteristics of every information system that every system designer wants to accomplish though its design. Information systems‘ usability is dependant mostly on the aims it had to serve. The development of an information system is dependent on a certain need of a business. Therefore, the better that need is fulfilled the more usable the information system is.  The analysis of sub question 2 identifies the involvement of users in co-design process as the most important aspect to enhance usability through co-design. The involvement of users in design process helps in a better understanding of user needs and also helps in combining the expertise of designer with user knowledge and experience with the information systems. Aligning the information systems with business goals and observing users use the system are also identified to be important factors for enhancing usability. Sometimes even the users are unable to identify their needs unless they are actually using the system after it is designed. So observation of that could also lead to improvement in design of system but that is usually a costly method because it leads to alterations in the already designed system. The best approach would be involving the users in design process from the early stages.  The analysis of sub question 3 enforces that the mental models of designers and users in co-design interact and lead to better understanding of problem hence leading to efficiency of the process. The wider the gap between mental models of participants, the more efficient the process is. Theoretical study has suggested that</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="478" confidence="possible" page="67" column="1">the longer the team members work together, the better the understanding and coordination among them. Their mental models coordinate and adapt to each other better. Despite this, diversity among stack holders leads to more creativity and innovation. The more different and creative concepts come from different minds, the less is the chance that any important aspect will be overlooked. The mental models of participants in a team make them act according to their predictions, understanding and knowledge of the task and situation and their coordination and influence on each other leads to better planning and better problem solving hence improving the co-design process. The greater convergence in mental models of team members leads to better performance and better problem solving. There is a direct relationship between convergence in team members‘ mental models and team performance. But the content of shared mental models comes first in the design process that affects team performance more. The diversity in a team leads to creativity and better problem solving. It is very important to determine which members are chosen in a team for a particular task because if they have the same mental models, they will have a limited approach to things. The characteristics that have an effect on mental models of members in a design team include diversity, knowledge/education and experience. As much as the knowledge of every individual in a team is important, the sharing of that knowledge with team members is also important. Every individual‘s judgments and understanding is a result of his knowledge and level of education. It is not important that an individual with higher level of education is the one who will benefit a team. It depends on his knowledge of that particular task.  The analysis of sub question 4 suggests that misunderstandings while developing information systems in an intercultural environment can be reduced by use of a common language by users and designers, increased time spent between designers and users, empowerment of each member of team and freedom to express in any mode of communication most comfortable to the individual. Not every individual can express in the same way or language as others. It is extremely important that during the communication phase no misunderstandings occur because that would waste the effort of bringing together individuals for the design process and will lead to failure of the designed system.</region>

          <h2 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="486" page="69" column="1">5.4 Implications for Informatics</h2>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="497" page="69" column="1">The research phenomenon of co-design for business and IT is connected to the field of informatics. Informatics is basically the study of the development and use of information systems. This topic is more about the development of information systems for any business. That is why his is directly linked to the field of informatics. Informatics is a very broad field that is related to the interaction of human and computer, information and social science and technology. <marker type="block"/> It can be merged with the academic disciplines. The methodology, technique and tools used for implementing and developing information systems are diverse. Co-design is considered to be an important tool when it comes to designing information systems. Designing, implementing and developing information systems should account for the interaction of all activities and business functions of an organization. The systems theory helps in relating the development of information systems to ethics and views it from the social and technological perspective. Developing the information system from this perspective can prove to be beneficial for the organization. Factors that determine the effectiveness of information systems help in guiding development, implementing and maintaining information systems.<marker type="block"/> In this section we study the implications for our empirical research results for the design of information systems. In order to support the problem solving of organizations like Sony<marker type="page" number="70"/><marker type="block"/> Ericsson we consider the design of information systems to be critical. The study of co-design for information systems for business and IT further leads to the study business and informatics. The informatics for business is more closely linked to management whereas the social informatics is related to the social aspects of technology and computerization since they support the organizations. The recent growth in information and communication technology has given rise to the concept of communication informatics. The thesis focused on the Swedish organization Sony Ericsson which is devoted to the use of information technology for facilitating its business processes. This shows its relation to the field of informatics. Sony Ericsson has a lot of expert systems being used in about 100 countries. All these systems meet the criteria for facilitating the business processes they are specially designed for. The information systems at Sony Ericsson are designed through close collaboration between designers and users. The methodologies, techniques and tools used for developing these systems include disciplines like computer and information science. The information systems at Sony Ericsson help in supporting different functions. The study has provided us with the conclusion that several issues linked to information systems deployed at Sony Ericsson impact the effectiveness of the information exchanged. Sustaining he relations based on trust helps in encouraging open communication between individuals working in an organization. Communication in organizations can be linked to a number of disciplines with direct implication to the field of informatics.<marker type="block"/> The implications for users include solving organization problems and making adaptations corporately. The individuals working in an organization need to communicate with each other and exchange information through these information systems. They can help in adapting and delegating tasks to other individuals. The delegation support should follow a certain pattern for organizations in order to provide ease of system‘s use for users. This makes improving the process of software and the use of this strategy helps in making the process more transparent. Adapting configurations, delegating mechanism can help in supporting corporative end user development. The users can help in solving problems of business processes to some extent because it helps in supporting the employees of a company in making adaptations. The introduction of information systems requires an open adaptation culture within an organization in which employees work with each other to solve problems. The major factor of considering the problem type needs to be identified and considered when designing n information system. If the problem type is considered while developing an information system, better quality system can be designed. Developing and integrating end user development tools on the basis of implication will help in proving the suggestions in practice.<marker type="block"/> In theoretical field too, this study has made important contribution. Under technology acceptance model, only than a person will use a system when he knows it is easy to use and ease his work. This is only possible when actually that system was build with keeping in mind user‘s requirement, his work, his participation at all development level. So that he can guide the designer that what are most important things, what is least etc. In this way if they feel any difficulty in use, user will try to overcome it because his ideas were taken at the time of developing the system.<marker type="page" number="71"/><marker type="block"/> In theory of planned behavior, when a person knows that his behavior will bring certain outcome of his choice he will be more willing to exert that behavior. So, accordingly, when a user knew that his provided information will help him in the betterment of his job. He will definitely help the system designing team at his best, because he knew that the system which is going to design will ease his job.<marker type="block"/> In production theory, whatever input is provided by the user, on that basis output will appear, and its use who have to use the output. So he will give more accurate input (required information), so that whatever system is made meet his requirement.<marker type="block"/> According to social cognitive theory, designer get a chance to observe the organizational setting, so that he can designs system accordingly. Sometime It help designer to notice some important minor point which user fail to explain.</region>

          <h2 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="512" page="73" column="1">6.1 Conclusions</h2>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="521" page="73" column="1">It is a very challenging task to meet the changing needs of the business world. Designing effective information technology for this purpose is also very challenging. The co-design of business and IT systems has a lot of benefits for the organizations. The information technology is basically used to support business and its functions. Therefore it is extremely important that the information technology is aligned with the business processes. It should be considered as a part of the business and should not be designed independently. The users of the technology should work in close collaboration with the designers during the co-design process which would result in an efficient information system. The technology needs to be viewed from the point of view of the agents who are supposed to use it and not from just the view of the designers who will only take part in its designing. Understanding the limitations and needs of individuals who are going to use the technology allows an analysis of the impact that the new technology will have on an organization in a given setting. Instead of focusing only on the characteristics of individual technologies, or psychological and social issues, all of these are combined in order to provide an explanation on the overall decisions of people who use the technology. <marker type="block"/> The thesis aims to investigate the factors that would help in creating a better communication between system designers and users during co-design in order to enhance the usability of a designed information system. It comprised of a theoretical and empirical study that helped in generating answers to the research sub-questions. In the theoretical study a foundation is constructed for co-design in relation to technology, business, designers and users which are all important factors in the designing of information systems. The theoretical study renders the fact that close collaboration between designers and users during co-deign helps in formation of a better information system that would eventually result in efficiency of the organization. The factors that help in creating a better communication between designers and users during co-design are important because the information system is very important for attaining efficiency for an organization and it is important that the information system is an efficient and useful one. The theoretical study coupled with empirical study helps us in perceiving the magnitude of better information systems to better organizational efficiency. This study will help organization to overcome the problems in designing the communication system, which user can use easily and meet their entire requirement. Mostly organization thinks that it is fault of the designer that they are not designing according to instruction but they should know that the need and support from management, who are actual user of the system is essential. Communication system flows in whole organization from top to down and down to top, so appropriate care should be taken in its designing by providing required help to designer.<marker type="page" number="74"/><marker type="block"/> Consistent themes reveled through theoretical study were issues related to communication problems and gaps between designers and users mental models. Understanding the fact that the users of information systems know better about the needs and requirements they want to fulfill through designed information system, the involvement of users in the design process becomes critical. Information systems designed with the involvement of users not only help in facilitating the business processes but also help in reducing the time and costs that would go into training employees for the use of the system. A better understanding of the user needs, knowledge and mental models helps in designing the systems that would not result in being difficult to learn and understand by the users.<marker type="block"/> The usability of information systems cannot be defined in the same way for every organization therefore a standard information system cannot be designed without keeping in mind the needs of the users and the requirements of the business. In order to better fulfill the needs of users and the business and to help in facilitation of business operations, the users play a major role in the co-design process. User knowledge, understanding, experiences and better understanding of business needs combined with designer‘s expertise helps in a better designed information system. Therefore the communication between designer and user is important during co-design. This communication is much more important during the initial stages of design process because if at that stage the latent needs of users are identified and an idea of their knowledge and understanding is clear to the designer, no modifications in design will be needed later. The user knowledge includes these major factors: product experience, contextual experience and ser preference. User knowledge is a part of the everyday practices of individual‘s which also contains the operational experience of using products, their personal experiences and preferences. The product experience helps in articulating the difficulties, problems and solutions related to operating the product. Their contextual experience is an articulation of their social and cultural issues. Their user preference articulates the explicit and implicit personal experiences. The designer‘s knowledge helps in providing either a totally new contribution or a continuation to the subject. The domain knowledge of designers is used to express the knowledge about manufacturing processes, organization and development issues which are only accessible because of the designers‘ expertise. Some of the problems that occur during the collaboration of designers and users include interruption, repetition of ideas or rephrasing. Some positive activities that occur during the collaboration between designer and user include reminding the opponent to return to main topic, reasoning (when the participants provide reasons for their choices and suggestion) and agreement.<marker type="block"/> The theoretical and empirical studies helped n identifying the factors that help in a better communication between designers and users during co-design. The longer the designers and users spend time with each other, the better they understand each other‘s mental models, their needs, their knowledge levels and their problems. When designers‘ spend more time communicating with the users, they identify their latent needs too, they understand what level of understanding and knowledge do they possess and what characteristics they are looking for in the information system. The users also help in communicating the needs of the business and the business operations they want to be facilitated by the use of IT. Sometimes the<marker type="page" number="75"/><marker type="block"/> designers also help in identifying such factors that are not identified by the users themselves. This can only happen if more communication takes place between the designer and user and the designer carefully analyzes the users and their needs and problems. Empowering each participant, whether it is the designers or users in the co-design process also helps in a better design of information system. The users need to be made aware of the power they hold in the process. They should not feel inferior to the designers. This would help them in being open about their problems and they would also contribute more. The issues related to use of language and medium of expression of ideas should also be given importance. The use of a common language during co-design also facilitates the communication process. The freedom of expressing in any mode convenient to the participants also helps in a better design process.<marker type="block"/> The empirical results are congruent with themes identified in the theoretical study. Sony Ericsson identified as an organization that gives a lot of importance to technology, Sony Ericsson makes the users an important part of design process when it comes to information systems. Although the information systems deployed have already proven to be quite effective for the organization, a better communication between designers and users during co-design would help in designing much better systems that would enhance creativity, innovation and facilitate the business processes in a much better way. The communication is much better when more time is spent between designers and users.</region>

The subject areas that helped in underpinning the use of information technology in businesses helped in constructing a theoretical outline of texts that were used in analysis. The text that was used in sampling of literature included articles published in academic and scientific journals. The sampling of this text helped in serving the research purpose. It also the most important findings of this text were applied to the research sub questions. The text could be interpreted in a variety of ways dependent upon the perspective of the analysis. There were times when the analysis of articles and books did not match and oppose each other due to the difference in theoretical framework. The difference was also due to the difference in times they were published. With <marker type="page" number="76"/><marker type="block"/> the progression of theoretical study, the author was able to better understand the concept of research topic.<marker type="block"/> Interviews have been proved to be a good method of generating information and during this research; the method has proven to be very effective. It helped to gain an insight into the internal functions of the organization. The empirical study consisted of two interviews in the same organization but at different levels of hierarchy. More interviews would have been taken but due to time constraints that was not possible. The first interview helped in testing the time required in answering questions present in interview guide. After the initial 15 minutes it was found out that the planned 1 hour would not be enough to complete the amount of questions designed. In order to build trust with the informants it was made sure that they are engaged in the conversation in a very normal way. Both the informants spoke English and they were quite comfortable with it although it was not their mother tongue. The interviewer made it clear to the informants that if there is anything they are able to express in English; they should not stop from saying that. Instead they can express it in Swedish. The first interview helped in finding different ways of prompting or more information. The second interview proved to be better than the first one because of the experience generated through the first interview. It was made sure that the mistakes are not repeated in the second interview.<marker type="block"/> Different Questions were asked from both the respondents because one was the designer of the information system and other was the user of information. From the first respondents information about designing process was obtained, and how users have helped him in providing information, assisting him in designing. Strategy of co designed really worked for them as it helps them to even take into consideration minute working of the employees.By interviewing second interviewee who is also the user and employee of the company, his experience in co-designing was discussed and how easy they feel in using the system. How they felt that they need a information system.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="538" page="76" column="1">The strategy used for evaluation of data as provided in chapter 2 is triangulation. It consisted of detailed interviews and published documents. They help in validating consistency. <marker type="block"/> Credibility It helps in measuring the quality of trustworthiness. Despite the fact that the time invested in the research was not that long, the researcher‘s knowledge of information systems and organizations helped in being confident while gathering and interpreting data. The techniques used for interpretation and generation of qualitative data include: case study used as research strategy, typical case sampling was used for sampling strategy, interviews were used for data generation and comparative analysis was the data analysis technique used. The text and figures used in theoretical study were related to the research topic. The organization Sony Ericsson chosen for the study fits the criteria for research and the<marker type="page" number="77"/><marker type="block"/> informants chosen for the interview has the knowledge that was required. The informants interviewed were from the lower level management and technology department.<marker type="block"/> Transferability Transferability is the ability of a research to be applicable across a given population. This can be found out through the sampling strategy. Purposive sampling has been used for research. The data population was selected by defining the requirements of source of interest. The source population used was an organization that deals with telecommunications equipment and is a data communication systems provider. As a result of research strategy of interviews the resource population was limited to Sweden. Considering the fact that the informant chosen is related to the use and designing of information systems, informant from systems department was chosen and the other informant was the one who was closely associated with the use of the designed systems.<marker type="block"/> Dependability This tells how well the research has been recorded. One major issue with qualitative research is that the environment keeps on changing. This research is not very unique and specific and its replication is not very difficult due to which it can influence outside the context of study. The method used for generating data is triangulation of 2 interviews and analysis of relevant documents. The comparison of empirical data with relevant literature review helped in comparatively analyzing the data.<marker type="block"/> Confirmability It helps in illuminating the level to which a participant‘s actions and perceptions are interpreted within a given context. Chapter 2 documents the methodological steps taken as the researcher progressed through the research methodology.<marker type="block"/> Ethics This is related to the moral in research. Everyone directly or indirectly involved in research has been treated with respect and the intellectual rights have been taken care of. Their confidentiality has been considered to be very important during the research.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="540" page="77" column="1">This research will help a lot in any organization in designing an information system by the collaboration of user and designer. In co-design more productive work will be done in less time and neither designer nor user will frustrate. User should be expressive so that he can express what he requires and designer should be qualified enough to interpret what is required to client. A good communication system will help in effective business management. Although attempt was taken to gathered data from whole target market. But due to time constraint only one company was studied. One person from both user and designer end are interviewed.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="543" page="78" column="1">It has been believed that the case studies are applicable to only the case under study. There is a possibility however that broad generalization can be made that would be relevant outside the given study. Since the qualitative research is done taking small sample sizes, generalizations are difficult to make. The research of co-design for business and IT are typical to other organizations. The knowledge generated in this thesis is related to information systems and communication between organizations which is common in every organization. Almost every organization these days makes use of information systems to some extent. This research helps in illuminating the factors that would enhance communication between designers and users during co-design for IT and businesses therefore it may have implications for all organizations that make use of information technology. The organization chosen for empirical study represents the emerging organizations that make use of information technology to facilitate the business processes and share some of the characteristics of research organization. The organizations that are affected by globalization and technological innovation can be included in the organizations similar to the one studied. The organizations which use information systems for their core operations are similar to the one being studied in this thesis, so the generalizations can be made here. The generalizations can also be made to the field of information systems. Information system developers might also find this research interesting and relevant.</region>

          <h2 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="544" page="78" column="1">6.7 Ideas for Future Research</h2>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="545" page="78" column="1">IT is lifeblood of today‘s business world. Without it no business can progress. An effective communication helps a business to work effectively. Flow of communication is required by both sides. This communication system needs to be improved by time to time as new technologies are invented. So this requires closing working of both user and designer to design such a design which meets all organizational needs. More work has been identified for future research. One direction that could be undertaken is the flexibility in architecture of information systems. This would help in expansion of systems related to data and functions. This would also result in a change in business processes, and refitting of information technology and business functions. The topic of information systems is very diverse but only a few aspects of this phenomenon could be undertaken. Some of the interesting areas of future research might include:  The role of IT in effective communication  The ways in which information systems can hurt an organization  Misunderstandings during communication in an intercultural environment  The characteristics of participants and their effect on co-design  The use of mental models for software developers  Use of mental models in training and development</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="665" confidence="possible" page="87" column="1">University of Borås is a modern university in the city center. We give courses in business administration and informatics, library and information science, fashion and textiles, behavioral sciences and teacher education, engineering and health sciences. In the School of Business and IT (HIT), we have focused on the students' future needs. Therefore we have created programs in which employability is a key word. Subject integration and contextualization are other important concepts. The department has a closeness, both between students and teachers as well as between industry and education. Our courses in business administration give students the opportunity to learn more about different businesses and governments and how governance and organization of these activities take place. They may also learn about society development and organizations' adaptation to the outside world. They have the opportunity to improve their ability to analyze, develop and control activities, whether they want to engage in auditing, management or marketing. Among our IT courses, there's always something for those who want to design the future of IT- based communications, analyze the needs and demands on organizations' information to design their content structures, integrating IT and business development, developing their ability to analyze and design business processes or focus on programming and development of good use of IT in enterprises and organizations. The research in the school is well recognized and oriented towards professionalism as well as design and development. The overall research profile is Business-IT-Services which combine knowledge and skills in informatics as well as in business administration. The research is profession-oriented, which is reflected in the research, in many cases conducted on action research-based grounds, with businesses and government organizations at local, national and international arenas. The research design and professional orientation is manifested also in InnovationLab, which is the department's and university's unit for research-supporting system development.</region>
