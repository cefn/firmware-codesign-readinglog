      <abstract class="DoCO:Abstract" id="7">Metamouse is a device enabling the user of a drawing program to specify graphical procedures by supplying example execution traces. The user manipulates objects directly on the screen, creating graphical tools where necessary to help make constraints explicit; the system records the sequence of actions and induces a procedure. Generalization is used both to identify the key features of individual program steps, disregarding coincidental events; and to connect the steps into a program graph, creating loops and conditional branches as appropriate. Metamouse operates within a 2D click-and-drag drafting package, and incorporates a strong model o f the relative imporlance of different types of graphical constraint. Close attention is paid to user interface aspects, and Metamouse helps the user by predicting and performing actions, thus reducing the tedium of repetitive graphical editing tasks.</abstract>

These relationships are called "constraints." Often they compete with each other and must be considered as a group, called a "constraint system." With or without the help of a computer, a graphic artist must manage constraints that may be complex and require compromise or careful ordering to be resolved. A drawing evolves as new objects and constraints are added and as some attributes and constraints change while others remain in force, These elements often interact; for example, changing a text font may require enlarging and re-positioning boxes in a flowchart. Despite the features provided by interactive graphics editors to automate constraints, editing still involves repetitive manual work that requires precision and planning.</region>

It observes the user at work, performs a localized analysis of changes in spatial relations to isolate constraints, and matches action sequences to build a state graph that contains conditional branches and loops. Moreover, it induces variables for objects and distinguishes constants from non-deterministic (ie. run-time input) parameters. The system includes a constraint solver to perform the actions it has learned.</region>

The metaphor embodies the s y s t e m ' s limited model of spatial relations: Metamouse is near-sighted but touch sensitive. The user understands that relations at a distance must be constructed, for example by using a line to demonstrate alignment. <marker type="block"/> Section 2 describes some example editing tasks that can be taught to Metamouse. Section 3 discusses research issues and related work. Section 4 describes the current implementation. This is followed, in Section 5, by an evaluation of its performance on the sample tasks.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="47" page="2" column="1">Several types of graphical task are appr~opriate for automation by a system such as Metamouse. Primary problems for users are 1) a c h i e v i n g precision, 2) m a i n t a i n i n g integrity of constraints <marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> throughout the editing process, and 3) coping with the tedium of repetition, Examples of each type of task are described in detail below.<marker type="block"/>  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" id="40" class="deo:Reference">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the construction of an arch from a sketch of its main components. Initially the artist draws one of the piers, a capital, and the spandrel's extents box. The capital is then centered over the pier and the spandrel box is moved down onto it with the desired lateral overhang. After m e a s u r i n g the overhang, the artist duplicates the pier and capitat at the other end of the arch. A triangular spandrel is then constructed inside the box. Finally, plinths are added to the base of the piers. This editing sequence specifies a procedure for constructing a type of arch from four graphical inputs: pier, capital, spandrel box, and overhang. The construction requires precision but need only be done once.<marker type="block"/> F i g u r e 2 illustrates constraints that must be m a i n t a i n e d throughout the long-term editing of a picture. If the stove is m o v e d , the ventilation hood must be re-positioned above the burners, and the stove-pipe must be stretched or shortened to reach the h o o d from the wall exit. The editing s e q u e n c e proceeds as follows. First, the user expresses the constraint between burners and hood by drawing a tie-line between them. The user then m o v e s the stove to its new position. The constraints are re-established as follows. The tie is m o v e d to touch the burner as before. The hood is m o v e d to contact the tie, and the stove-pipe is stretched to the hood. Finally, the tie-line is r e m o v e d (or hidden). This task illustrates the use of an auxiliary object (the tie) to express a constraint. O t h e r constraints stem from the role that touches play in terminating actions. This procedure could be invoked manually whenever the stove is moved, but it would be desirable to "attach" it to the operation of m o v i n g the stove, which would automatically trigger it.<marker type="block"/>  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" id="43" class="deo:Reference">Figure 3</xref> illustrates a repetitive editing operation or an animation sequence. A teapot moves up and down rows of cups laid out on a buffet, filling them with tea, and then returns to its initial position. Since cups are not perfectly aligned, a row is defined by a line passing through the center of one cup and touching the others. A procedure looping on rows and cups would allow us to change these numbers without re-scripting. M o r e o v e r , a constraint-oriented description of the teapot's path (eg. " m o v e rightward to next cup" rather than " m o v e to (x, y)") w o u l d tolerate adjustments to the layout. A program for this task is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" id="44" class="deo:Reference">Figure 4</xref>.<marker type="block"/> The teapot's initial position is marked with a slash and the pot moves to the table's nearest corner. For each iteration of the main loop, the row-line advances upwards to the center of some cup - - a sweep-selection method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19" id="46" class="deo:Reference">19</xref>]. The pot m o v e s to the r o w - l i n e ' s near end. For each cycle of the inner loop, the pot advances to meet the following constraints: i) the spout is at the center of some cup, C; ii) C is touching the row-line; and iii) C was not already visited. At the end of a row, some of these constraints fail. Note that the constraints ensure that the pot moves in opposite directions in successive rows. The main loop ends when no cups remain in the row-line's upward path. The teapot then returns to its initial position marker via the buffet's perimeter and, finally, the marker is removed.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="65" confidence="possible" page="3" column="1">The power of a system like Metamouse lies in its ability to isolate constraints and predict actions. The user performs only a few steps of the tea-party task. Once Metamouse detects repetition, it predicts subsequent actions until it cannot meet the constraints or until the user objects. It observes the teapot move to the second cup and predicts all actions for the rest of row 1. When it fails to find a fourth cup, it asks the user to take over. The user moves the row-line; Metamouse recognizes this action and hence predicts the move-and-pour sequences for the second and third rows.</region>

Interactive help began with Sketchpad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22" id="68" class="deo:Reference">22</xref>], which used iterative numerical relaxation to resolve several types of constraint among object parameters. A similar approach is adopted in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27" id="69" class="deo:Reference">27</xref>], which lets users compose constraints based on least-squares relaxation. Recent research has also produced a system that automatically selects and applies appropriate construction tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4" id="70" class="deo:Reference">4</xref>].

Given that most users are non-programmers, research has focussed on graphical methods, often based on geometric construction [5, 7, 8, 171. With their graphical interfaces and use of examples, these systems greatly simplify program construction, but users must still work with abstractions. When programming with L.E.G.O. or a macro facility such as [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24" id="82" class="deo:Reference">24</xref>], the user declares loops and conditional branches, albeit by menu selection.

M o r e o v e r , systems of equations to represent these transformations would be numerically unstable and difficult to solve. Thus, it is better to induce a sequence of simpler transformations. Drawing is inherently procedural, often systematically ordered with each step governed by very few constraints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26" id="100" class="deo:Reference">26</xref>]. Nonetheless, it is hard to induce procedures even from simple steps. Typical users do not always construct (or know how to construct) the relevant measurements and relations, but work instead by visual inspection. In effect, their drawings include invisible objects, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" id="101" class="deo:Reference">Figure 5</xref>. Curve-matching methods such as those employed in graphical search and replace [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10" id="102" class="deo:Reference">10</xref>] are not sufficient for inducing patterns in traces that contain invisible objects. On the other hand, examining the screen for implicit spatial relations clearly involves an enormous amount of search and vastly expands the space of hypotheses for generalization. Therefore the system should isolate a small neighborhood of attention, and restrict itself to explicit relations of touch. It follows that user must specify these constructively.</region>

The Metamouse system uses a metaphorical apprentice, intensive interaction, and generalization to help the teacher. The Metamouse is the system's focus of attention; only touch relations involving it or an object it is grasping are examined. The system tries possible generalizations and predicts actions as early as possible during a teaching session, to eliminate free variation and extraneous actions and also to reduce errors. It can learn alternative actions and re-order their precedence in order to overcome errors. It has an internal model of graphical constraints and asks for explanation when an action seems arbitrary, ie. insufficiently constrained. The metaphor encourages the teacher to demonstrate constraints and adopt an intentional stance toward the system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="133" class="deo:Reference">6</xref>] rather than understand the details of its constraint and generalization models. Whether or not the metaphor succeeds is an experimental question; some pilot tests have yielded encouraging results [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14" id="134" class="deo:Reference">14</xref>].</region>

The flow of data through the system is sketched in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" id="138" class="deo:Reference">Figure 6</xref>. When the teacher performs a drawing operation, the system records it and augments it with explanatory features, matching objects with variables and identifying probable constraints on the cursor's new position. Metamouse moves to the point at which the action terminated and highlights object parts involved in constraints. The augmented action is then matched with program steps previously learned. If a match is found, the learning module may conjecture a loop or joining of branches. It then predicts subsequent actions to confirm this. Predicted actions are performed by a constraint solver. Metamouse autonomously moves and highlights objects, and continues to do so until the teacher rejects a prediction or the constraint solver fails.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="149" confidence="possible" page="5" column="2">Constraints are easier to identify and resolve if primitive operations have few degrees of freedom. Thus a drawing program with a point-and-click user interface, like MacDraw [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12" id="146" class="deo:Reference">12</xref>], is suitable. Our drawing program, A.Sq (after the protagonist of Flatland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1" id="147" class="deo:Reference">1</xref>]), emulates MacDraw but at present includes only box and line primitives. The user draws and transforms primitive objects by moving iconic handles (as in MacDraw). These handles delimit parts of objects distinguished by the learning system. They appear whenever the cursor (or Metamouse) approaches them, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" id="148" class="deo:Reference">Figure 7</xref>.</region>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="153" confidence="possible" page="5" column="2">The choice of primitives and operators has a great impact on the user's expression of constraints.

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="154" confidence="possible" page="5" column="2">At present, the drawing program is relatively simple yet rich enough to study programming-by-example issues. No conceptual difficulties are envisaged in extending the learning system to cope with new primitives such as points, polygons, ellipses, and splines, since only an object's distinguished parts have any significance. We also expect to be able to accommodate new operations such as rotation, grouping, and coloring.</region>

When searching for and transforming objects, the constraint solver is governed by touch relations and Basil's path of movement. The constraint inducer examines touch feedback obtained after each step of the trace. It weeds out trivial or irrelevant touches; the survivors comprise the postcondition of a program step. <marker type="block"/> Although all A.Sq drawing and transformation operators are based on translating CurrentPoint in 2-D display space, user actions occur in a model space containing objects with numerous parts, and in the "activity space" in which several alternative actions may be possible at any given time. Thus Basil operates with multiple degrees of freedom (and hence constraint) in the selection of actions and their parameters. Touch relations have 6 degrees of freedom, 3 on each item: selection of object, part, and position within part.</region>

Such touches may help select an action. They can distinguish otherwise similar situations, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10" id="225" class="deo:Reference">Figure 10</xref>. Here, the touch between point T and the rectangle seems irrelevant, since contact between Box.bottom.left and M e t a m o u s e ' s snout determines the move. But touch (Line.endpt : Box.top)versus touch (Line.endpt : Box.top.right) distinguishes a rectangle from a square. The teacher clicks on the relation icon to change its status.<marker type="block"/> The classifier can detect a lack of sufficient constraint for viable solutions. If all touches are only strong or weak, Basil's path is made a weak constraint with the caveat that the solver may have to relax it. In case of a total lack of touch constraint, Basil asks the user to indicate which of a set of standard tacit constraints, such as input or constant position, applies to this action.<marker type="block"/> Determining, strong, and weak constraints are c o n s i d e r e d relevant; o v e r d e t e r m i n e d , trivial and sustained touches are ignored. Such heuristic rules can provide at most a best guess as to the teacher's precise intentions. As mentioned in Section 4.3 and illustrated in F i g u r e 10, the t e a c h e r can o v e r r i d e Metamouse's decision to ignore a touch relation.<marker type="block"/> The learning algorithm takes the linear sequence of steps performed by the teacher and builds a directed graph containing branches and loops. It operates interactively, so that each new step is integrated into the graph as it is performed, If the user's action matches an existing step, the system conjectures a link to that step. A link is verified by predicting its successors.<marker type="block"/> Each step is a program-node (Predecessors, Action, Successors) structure. Its location in the graph is expressed as lists of Predecessors and Successors. The Action is an action-step (Preconditions, Operation, Postconditions) tuple. Operation is one of the A.Sq operators. Pre- and Postconditions are lists of constraints that must hold before and after executing the action. Preconditions are checked by examining Basil's current sensory</region>

Since all A.Sq actions result from translating a single point, the solver is much simpler than most. It examines the list of P o s t c o n d i t i o n s in order of strength. It generates a solution to the first and then checks that the rest hold. If not, it backtracks to an alternative solution for the first constraint. The process repeats until all constraints hold or no more solutions exist. Details appear in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15" id="238" class="deo:Reference">15</xref>]. The constraint solver is potentially able to generalize the P o s t c o n d i t i o n s ; at present, only Basil's path is generalized.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="243" confidence="possible" page="8" column="1">Real-time performance is governed by the number of program steps and touch relations to be checked by the action matcher and constraint solver. The complexity of a prediction is proportional to the product of these numbers. The number of touch relations is normally quite small, due to the limited range of Basil's touch sense. At most, it is twice the number of object-parts, since every relation involves either Basil or the object in his grasp. The number of program steps is unbounded; hence it may be advisable to limit the search for a matching step.</region>

In the first row, the teacher moved the row-line into contact with the cups, then moved the teapot to the row-line's nearest end-point, and then rightward to the first cup. After marking the cup (that is, pouring the tea), the teacher advanced the pot to the next cup, which triggered predictions to mark it and repeat for the third. On attempting a fourth iteration, the constraint solver failed to find another cup in Metamouse's path; this failure was the loop's terminating condition. When the teacher advanced the row-line to the next row, the matcher generalized the contact constraints between row-line and cups, since row 2 contained only one cup. The system then successfully predicted that the teapot would advance and thus induced the outer loop. The direction of the teapot's movement along the row was generalized from rightward to horizontal in order to make subsequent predictions. The loops were now general enough to cover the third row.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="268" confidence="possible" page="9" column="1">The current implementation is unsuitable for much further research. It is too slow and unreliable; expansion of facilities will only exacerbate these problems. Hence we are re- i m p l e m e n t i n g Metamouse in C++ on A p o l l o DN4500 workstations. When a prototype is ready, we will conduct studies with casual users. Graphics primitives such as circles, ellipses and splines are planned, as well as object rotation and grouping. Further desirable additions include the ordering of alternative predictions by generality or frequency, and a pattern- matching command to allow the user to specify a pattern without constructing a procedure.</region>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="269" confidence="possible" page="9" column="1">The nature of Metamouse raises several important questions. The system is designed to build a predictive model of human performance by conjecturing intentions behind isolated actions. This focus of attention should be expanded to sequences so that the system might identify free variation on the order of actions, equivalence, ineffectiveness, and so on. Metamouse also facilitates rich interaction. Methods of eliciting constraints from the teacher should be compared with respect to the trade-offs between inductive generalization and explicit indication. Induction of some implicit spatial relations, such as alignment, is not infeasible. On the other hand, graphical gesturing, as in pointing to interesting touch relations, shows promise as a natural technique for teaching.</region>

        <h1 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="270" page="9" column="1">7 Conclusions</h1>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="271" confidence="possible" page="9" column="1">Metamouse demonstrates that it is indeed possible for users to create graphical procedures by direct manipulation. Applications range from producing complex, repetitive drawings, through constructively specifying figures governed by graphical constraint, to generating simple animated algorithms for tasks such as sorting (and pouring tea). Metamouse eagerly reveals its predictions as soon as it can. This has three advantages. First, users reap early benefits when performing repetitive operations. Second, they can correct errors as soon as they occur. Third, they develop confidence in their programs without ever viewing any kind of listing. The principal shortcomings of the current system are its limited repertoire of graphical objects and transformations, the lack of a formal underpinning for the constraint model, and our limited experience of how users react to the new experience of working with Metamouse.</region>
