It encompasses a huge range of issues, theories, technologies, designs, tools, environments and human experiences in knowledge work, recreation and leisure activity, teaching and learning, and the potpourri of everyday life. The series publishes state-of-the-art syntheses, case studies, and tutorials in key areas.

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="14" page="8" column="1">viii ABSTRACT Digital technology has become a defining characteristic of modern life. Almost everyone uses it, we all rely on it, and many of us own a multitude of devices. What is more, we all expect to be able to use these technologies “straight out the box.” This lecture discusses how we are able to do this without apparent problems. We are able to use digital technology because we have learned to cope with it. “To cope” is used in philosophy to mean “absorbed engagement,” that is, we use our smart phones and tablet computers with little or no conscious effort. In human-computer interaction this kind of use is more often described as intuitive. While this, of course, is testament to improved design, our in- terest in this lecture is in the human side of these interactions. We cope with technology because we are familiar with it. We define familiarity as the readiness to engage with technology which arises from being repeatedly exposed to it—often from birth. This exposure involves the frequent use of it and seeing people all around us using it every day. Digital technology has become as common a feature of our everyday lives as the motor car, TV, credit card, cutlery, or a dozen other things which we also use without conscious deliberation. We will argue that we cope with digital technology in the same way as we do these other technologies by means of this everyday familiarity. But this is only half of the story. We also regularly support or scaffold our use of technology. These scaffolding activities are described as “epistemic actions” which we adopt to make it easier for us to accomplish our goals. With digital technology these epistemic actions include appropriating it to more closer meet our needs. In summary, coping is a situated, embodied, and distributed description of how we use digital technology.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="76" page="19" column="1">The use of digital technology is now a major part of our lives, and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has created a whole raft of models and descriptions that tell us what we use it for. We also know why we use this technology rather than that technology; where and when we use it (at home, on the move, at work) and how frequently we use it. In short, we have a fairly comprehensive picture of its role in modern life, except to say, that there is no account of how we use it. The aim of this lecture is do just that, to offer an account of how we use digital technology by drawing upon psychological, philosophical, cognitive science, and human-computer interaction research. We start from where we find ourselves, surrounded by a heterogeneous mix of technologies being used by a very diverse population typically without much difficulty. This is all the more re- markable as only some thirty years ago researchers struggled to find a way to present what were then unfamiliar technologies to people. The desktop metaphor was invented as were a host of input and output devices. We created psychological models of how people thought about it. We worried about training, the writing of manuals, and of user acceptance. Now, of course, we worry about the effects of overusing technology and even “addiction.” Surveys reported in the popular press tell us that people “can’t live without their phones,” prefer their phones to their children, and that the number of mobile computing devices is about to exceed the number of people on the planet. We also learn that these technologies are making us stupid, violent, or obese (or all three). Whether or not this is mere hyperbole, the simple truth is that for many of us the routine use of digital technology is an everyday fact of life. So, how do we use digital technology? It will be argued that we cope with it. This is not the coping of solicitude. Instead, borrowing the term from philosophy, it is taken to mean “absorbed engagement.” Used in this way, coping is a description of how we broadly deal with the world and everything it comprises. We have learned to cope with digital technology in the same ways that we have learned to cope with cutlery, washing machines, automatic bank tellers, TVs, motorcars, and so forth (but we exclude operating a nuclear power station, flying commercial airliners, and other such complex, safety critical activities from this list). We have learned to cope with these technologies because they surround us, because we may have been instructed in their use, because we have watched others use them, because we have to, and because we want to. We cope with digital technology without conscious deliberation or reflection, indeed, we might say intuitively. While coping does not rely <marker type="page" number="20"/><marker type="block"/> 1. INTRODUCTION on conscious deliberation, it is nonetheless adaptive, that is, we respond flexibly to the demands of the situation. Further we also scaffold our coping with heuristics, short-cuts, and a whole host of “work- arounds” and supporting behaviours. These we collectively describe as epistemic actions (Kirsh and Maglio, 1994). These actions help us achieve our goals by making them less demanding. While examples of epistemic actions are readily identified, as we discuss in Chapter 4, coping with digital technology does, however, differ from the use of other technologies in one important respect. We frequently personalise it, configure it, and in doing so we make it better suited to the ways in which we want to use it. In short, we appropriate it. This is not to suggest that appropriation is confined to digital technology but it does seem to be one of its defining characteristics. In recent years research into how we appropriate technology has grown dramatically. Appropriation is now recognised to encompass not only personalisation and configuration, but includes re-use, sustainability, and what has been described as “ensoulment.” There is even growing interest in designing for appropriation (though this is deemed by some as oxymoronic; Dix, 2007). However, for the purposes of this lec- ture, we will treat appropriation in a very specific way, namely, as a form of epistemic action involved with making digital technology easier to use and more appropriate to how we want to use it.<marker type="block"/> 1.1 DIGITAL NATIVES Accepting that digital technology is one of the defining features of our everyday lives has prompted some to consider what effect this has had on us. This kind of discussion varies widely between the utopian and dystopian, the enthusiastic and the horrified, the popular and the academic. Nicholas Carr, for example, has famously asked, “Is Google making us stupid” (Carr, 2008). By “Google,” of course, he intends the Web as a whole and goes on to wonder about the effect digital technology has on our ability to think, read, and remember (Carr, 2010). Similarly McGonagall (2011) has published astonishing statistics about how much time people spend playing video games while proposing that such games provide a panacea for the ills of everyday life as they are a source of “positive experiences.” One area of real concern is the effect of interactive technology on the cognitive and emo- tional development of children and young people. While this is undoubtedly important, it is not the focus here. Instead we note that early, repeated, everyday exposure of children to digital tech- nology results in their familiarity with it. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1.1" id="68" class="deo:Reference">Figure 1.1</xref> is an image of two-year-old Ella. Ella loves pretending to be a dinosaur, loves being read stories, and using her parents’ iPad. The picture of Ella is not intended to convey something about the hours she might spend in front of a screen (to the exclusion of other activities) but that technologies like the iPad are simply a part of her everyday life along with her toy sheep. She is becoming familiar with technology and learning to cope with it as a matter of course. This is unremarkable and no different in kind to learning to read, getting dressed, completing a jigsaw, and so forth.<marker type="page" number="21"/><marker type="block"/> Toy manufacturers (e.g., BRIO) also ensure that children’s familiarity with this kind of tech- nology begins early. They offer “my first mobile phone” (a toy) which is said to be suitable for chil- dren aged 10 months and over which is more or less at the threshold of the child’s first spoken word. In practice, of course, children really do not have much of a choice about this as they find themselves being “thrown”, to use Heidegger’s term, into a world filled with this technology (Heidegger’s Obscure Terminology). One popular characterisation of the consequences of this early and repeated exposure to technology is Prensky’s (2001) “digital native”, and although he is specifically describing students, many of his remarks may generalise to the wider population. He writes, “Today’s students represent the first generations (sic) to grow up with this new technology. They have spent their entire lives surrounded by and using computers, videogames, digital music players, video cams, cell phones,<marker type="page" number="22"/><marker type="block"/> 1. INTRODUCTION and all the other toys and tools of the digital age. Today’s average college grads have spent less than 5,000 hours of their lives reading, but over 10,000 hours playing video games [... ] Computer games, email, the Internet, cell phones and instant messaging are integral parts of their lives.” Pren- sky goes on to argue that these “digital natives” may be so expert with digital technology that they may prove to be impossible to teach by “non-natives.” While finding students difficult to teach is a complaint rediscovered by every generation of lecturers, more interestingly he observes that differ- ences in the use of language between generations may be the real issue. We discuss the importance of language in Sections 2.5 and 4.6.</region>

        <region class="unknown" id="79" page="22" column="1">Ready-to-Hand Ready-to-hand-ness is probably Heidegger’s most familiar expression to HCI specialists. The current treatment of the term is to regard it as simply meaning handy or handiness (Verbeek, p. 79) . However we will begin be treating it as meaning “available.” Dreyfus and Wrathall (2005, p. 4) in their introduction to a collection of essays on Heide- gger write, “we first encounter worldly things as available. Something is encountered as available when: it is defined in terms of its place in a context of equipment, typical activities in which it is used, and typical purposes and goals for which it is used, and it lends itself to such use readily and easily without need for reflection. The core case of availability is an item of equipment that we know how to use and that transparently lends itself to use.” The italicised sentence gets to the nub of readiness-to-hand for the current discussion. When we see an item of technology (a) we know how to use it and (b) we become absorbed in that use. If the technologies meet these criteria then it is being experienced as being ready-to-hand (RTH). Availability (another near synonym for RTH) also means proximal. Availability refers to the experience of using the technology and not to the technology per se, it is not a design feature. Readiness-to-hand is also a recognition that we do not encounter technology as discrete objects but as part of a meaningful network of things we can use, exploit, or engage with. This means that the expression “item of technology” as used above, is not quite right. Present-at-Hand</region>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="80" confidence="possible" page="22" column="1">Experiencing technology as being present-at-hand stands in contrast with readi- ness-to-hand.

This is the world objectively present (Verbeek, When we encounter something as present-at-hand it is in terms of the bare facts; we are not involved. Being present-at-hand is not the way in which we usually encounter the world, so is seen as somewhat secondary. Dasein</region>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="84" confidence="possible" page="23" column="1">The word Dasein is derived from da-sein, which literally means being-there or there-being, though this is not a translation with which Heidegger was happy. It has also been taken to mean “existence” and “human being.” In his Being and Time (1927/1962, p. 27) Heidegger writes, “This entity which each of us is himself ... we shall denote by the term Dasein.” The argument is that the identity of each of us is essentially indeterminate and necessarily contingent. Our identities, for Heidegger, are a consequence of our “know-how.” We are surgeons because we can conduct surgery, actors because we can act, celebrities because we are celebrated. Throwness (Geworfenheit) The concept of throwness, along with ready-to-hand and present-at-hand, are the three Heideggerian terms which Winograd and Flores introduced to the HCI community in the 1980s. While throwness has a particularly opaque formal definition, they offer a much more useful illustration of the term. They invite us to imagine that we are chairing a meeting. We must allow people to speak, take a vote, cut off speakers as required, keep the meeting on topic, and so forth. Winograd and Flores (1986) observe from this example of being thrown in this situation that: (i) we cannot avoid acting—as chairs we are thrown into action; (ii) we cannot step back and reflect—we are thrown back on our instincts and must deal with issues as they arise. In short we cannot act like dispassionate scientists weighing the evidence but as people thrown into real-world, evolving situations (ibid, pp. 33-36).</region>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="100" page="23" column="1">1.2 UNRULY, COMPLEX TECHNOLOGY Digital technology has indeed become ubiquitous but in a manner which does not quite match the original conception as articulated by Weiser. He described it as the seamless embedding of informa- tion processing into everyday objects and activities, writing that “the most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are in- distinguishable from it” (Weiser, 1991). While this fabric has indeed been populated by all manner of digital technology, to suggest that it is seamless would be optimistic. Since Weiser’s insight, a number of attempts have been made to realise this. Weiser and Brown (1996) have proposed de- signing what they describe as “Calm Technology” which, “informs but doesn’t demand our focus or <marker type="page" number="24"/><marker type="block"/> 1. INTRODUCTION attention” while Wisneski and his colleagues (1998) have proposed “ambient displays” which make use of existing spaces to afford interaction, and Tolmie et al. (2002) have proposed “Unremarkable Computing” which aims at encouraging designers to support the mundane, everyday routines of life with digital technology. In reality, rather than these proposed seamless, embedded technologies, we have the problem of interaction complexity ( Janlert and Stolterman, 2010) arising from artefact ecologies ( Jung et al., 2008; Ryan et al., 2009). Bødker and Klokmose (2012a, p. 448) tell us that the last decade has seen our ecologies transformed from the simple, perhaps comprising a single personal computer (PC), to the complex made up from “music players, gaming consoles, smartphones, PCs, entertainment systems, interactive walls etc.” Their interest, however, is in the seams between technologies and not in seamlessness per se. These discussions serve to highlight the everyday nature of technological ubiquity as unruliness rather than smooth embeddedness.<marker type="block"/> 1.3 MONDAY, MONDAY A typical Monday morning at work for me begins with switching on my computer. After it has booted, I enter my user name and password. The next task of the day is to have a quick look at my email. A single click on the email icon and the application loads. New messages appear in bold, some may be flagged as urgent, and a number will have been routed to the trash in response to the rules I have created. While I am getting my papers together and making a cup of tea, the reminder system pops up and flags an event at 10.00 am. This also prompts me to check my calendar ... and so on ... This unremarkable description includes examples of automatic, habitual, and routine behaviour. Many of the tasks involve digital technology but others do not. We enter our network credentials, we use a computer mouse, we start applications, we make a cup of tea, we scan for un- read email, we gather papers together, and so forth automatically and with scarce a thought. This kind of description, which is boringly familiar to me, plays out in a multitude of variants. Perhaps, for others, the morning is centred around checking one’s social media account or grabbing a quick video game before going to school. Irrespective of these differences, these routines and habits are the fabric of everyday life. This perspective is echoed by Agre who tells us that “everyday life is al- most wholly routine ...” which he defines as, “a frequently repeated pattern of interaction between an agent and its familiar environment” (1997, p. 107). We will discuss the nature of this familiarity in some detail in the next chapter.<marker type="block"/> 1.4 THE HABITUAL NATURE OF EVERYDAY LIFE William James (1890, p. 122) recognised the importance of habits, writing, “We must make au- tomatic and habitual, as early as possible, as many useful actions as we can.” He even suggested, perhaps a little unkindly, that “the young” will become mere walking bundles of habits and, of<marker type="page" number="25"/><marker type="block"/> course, we were all young once. Dewey (1922, p. 178) adds that habits do not require conscious thought, writing, “we walk and read aloud, we get off and on street cars, we dress and undress, and do a thousand useful acts without thinking of them.” These sentiments have been echoed by Pol- lard (2006) who writes that we often use “habit” as an explanation of everyday life, concluding his discussion by observing, “When we consider just how much of our lives we spend exercising habits, rather than subjecting our actions to deliberation [...] thought is very helpful when we are in novel or important circumstances, the rest of the time it rather gets in the way ... we only think when our habits give out” (p. 18). Pollard also asks us to consider how we acquire a habit. He invites us to imagine someone acquiring the habit φ. Initially, she is able to φ but not automatically; instead φ-ing requires thought and concentration. After repetition, φ-ing has become automatic, φ-ing has become part of what she does. Eventually φ-ing is not just second nature: it has become part of the bundle of habits which define her. So, for Pollard, habits begin as deliberate actions and through repetition they become automatic. Stephen Turner (1994, p. 16) expands on this telling us that “Habit is a hybrid term, at once mentalistic and observational. The difference between habits and repetitive behaviours, or the distinction between habit and innate inclination or impulsive act is an aetiological one. To have a habit is to have a particular kind of mental cause operating.” He goes on, “Habits are acquired, and there is something which persists between manifestations, a mental trace. The same kind of reasoning that we grant in the case of habits with directly visible manifestations, that there is an invisible “mental” element by virtue of which the visible pattern of behaviour persists, may be ex- tended to those “habits of mind”, that we can identify and speak of only indirectly, through complex inferences.” Norros (2005) offers an alternate description of habits from a semiotic perspective. She regards habits as having three interlinked characteristics. The first of these is the repetitious regu- larity of behaviour. It is this aspect that we emphasise in our everyday use of the term. The second characteristic of habits is that they “offer[s] the possibility to express meaning in action” (p. 388). She continues, habits are the way of being for most of us and can be understood in terms of per- sonal habit. We have individual, habitual ways of thinking, speaking, behaving, and so forth. What is being repeated is our way of coping with the world. This repetition of the message is the third and final defining characteristic of a habit in that it has a reflexive component. In summary, habits are useful; most of our everyday behaviours comprise habits; habits have to be learned, and habits are regularities of behaviour. But simply to describe our use of digital technology as habitual is not enough. Coping, as will be argued, offers a much richer account of use and as such the opportunity of greater insight into our everyday use of technology.<marker type="block"/> 1.5 COPING, COMPORTMENT, AND COGNITION As we have already said, coping as a description of our dealings with the world is drawn from the philosophical literature (e.g., Heidegger, 1927/1962; Dreyfus, 1991; Valera, 1992; Wheeler, 2005).<marker type="page" number="26"/><marker type="block"/> 1. INTRODUCTION Although differing in detail, these accounts emphasise our smooth, unreflective, non-representa- tional dealings with the world. Examples of coping include being able to eat a meal, make a cup of tea, type at a keyboard, swipe the surface of a mobile phone with a finger, drive a car and, of course, the philosophers’ favourite example, being skilled with a hammer. It is also emphasised that coping does not rely on explicit knowledge or an underlying cognitive representation but is better thought of as comportment which is “an according with” the task or technology in hand. Coping may be thought of as “cognition in action” and as such is a little at odds with the traditional or classical accounts of our use of digital technology. These accounts were largely predicated on some form of information processing paradigm. In general, it is supposed that we have a cognitive representation of the operation of the digital technology which we manipulate in order to formulate plans which in turn we execute (e.g., Card et al., 1983; Norman, 1983; 1988; John and Kieras, 1996). While these “mental model” approaches were once popular, they have less currency today. Classical cognition has, of course, been eclipsed by the appearance of various forms of extended, external, shared, embodied, distributed, and situated cognition hypotheses. These different accounts vary considerably but all would agree that cognition is neither confined to an individual brain nor limited to abstract deliberation. Instead, cognition will be treated in this lecture primarily as the ability to function effectively in the world while recognising that it is embodied, situated and so forth. In many respects coping and cognition are one and the same but it must be emphasised that our primary focus is confined to how we successfully use digital technology. Put another way, in only a generation we have gone from wondering how to get people to use this new and unfamiliar digital technology (focussing on technology acceptance and ease of use) to wondering how almost everyone seems to be able to use complex technology with such apparent ease.<marker type="block"/> 1.6 ACTIONS TO SUPPORT COPING From the description of coping we have considered so far, it might appear that we have reduced the typical person to little more than an automaton responding unthinkingly to the stimuli (and affordances) offered by digital technology. But this is not so. While coping describes most of our everyday use of digital technology it is not a complete account. To coping we add a supporting role for the epistemic. For a definition of this we follow Goldman (1986, p. 13) who describes it as dealing with “affairs of the intellect”, which include “[ ... ] the entire canvas of topics the mind can address: the nature of man-made symbols and cul- ture, and even the simple layout of objects in the immediate environment. The ways that minds do or should deal with these topics, individually or in concert, comprise the province of epistemology.” So, by the epistemic or the epistemological we do not just mean knowledge, as we also in- clude those acts which are intended to make the technology easier to use, better suited to us, and<marker type="page" number="27"/><marker type="block"/> as such accord with Kirsh and Maglio’s (1994) definition of epistemic actions. Epistemic actions involve people changing their environment, their ways of working and making the technology itself more appropriate. Thus, just as we neatly stack dishes before we wash them, we store our files in folders (both electronic and paper) for ease of retrieval, we use timetables to maximise the chance of catching a train to work, and we operate multiple email accounts to manage work and home correspondence. Many of these actions are purely contingent, short-lived, and dynamic while others are well established. As we shall see in Chapter 4 examples of epistemic actions are myriad. While it is recognised that coping and epistemic actions do not necessarily fit together phil- osophically (as will be also discussed in detail in Chapter 4) their successful union relies on their mutual availability. In short, coping must be able to access and exploit what the epistemic actions provide without “missing a beat”, that is, there should be no need for conscious deliberation to make use of them. The parallel with the operation of affordances is both clear and intended. Consider the following simple illustration of coping supported by epistemic actions: imagine one has a morning meeting in London for which we must catch the early morning flight. Not being at our best at 0500, we leave our keys and notes, mobile phone, wallet, and so forth in strategic locations to serve both as reminders to take them and as things we must take with us. We plan this in advance. Leaving keys and travel documents along the route we will take ensures that we will encounter them and take them with us. We scaffold “our going to the airport” coping with artefacts made deliberately proximal and available. Picking up these artefacts does not require deliberation but is intuitive: recognising our car keys does not require conscious thought, unlike remembering to pick them up from the drawer in the kitchen where they are usually kept. While these “bread- crumbs” are planned and deliberate, their use is intuitive, direct and immediate. So, having proposed that we cope with digital technology, a more complete description is to recognise that this coping is supported or “scaffolded” by a host of epistemic actions.<marker type="block"/> 1.7 THIS LECTURE The aim of this lecture is to describe the constituent and dynamic aspects of this formulation of coping and as such provide an account of how we use digital technology. The ensuing chapters expand on the aspects of coping just introduced. We begin by arguing that we cope because we are familiar with digital technology and this familiarity is born of our habitual use of it and our early, frequent, and vicarious exposure to it. From there we move to a consideration of what is meant by coping from a number of complementary philosophical and psychological perspectives. Moving from coping, epistemic actions are described together how they serve to scaffold our coping. This lecture concludes with a discussion of how this account of coping fits with the main body of HCI.</region>
