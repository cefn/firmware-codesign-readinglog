      <abstract class="DoCO:Abstract" id="5">This study consists of four experimental meetings, which explore whether functions of sketching in design activity are also valid for idea generation meetings in design. The relevant functions of sketching found in theory are: 1) supporting a re-interpretive cycle in the individual thinking process, 2) supporting re- interpretation of each other’s ideas in group activity, and 3) enhancing the access to earlier ideas. The results provide some support for the first and the third function. No support was found for the second function.</abstract>

      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="16" page="1" column="1">Idea generation techniques, like brainstorming, are commonly applied by designers for generating ideas. In the existing body of idea generation techniques, the primary mode of expressing ideas is in written language. Usually, during idea generation meetings, brief descriptions of ideas are listed on a flipchart. In contrast, when involved in unstructured design meetings, designers tend to make extensive use of sketching when generating design ideas. Researchers have often connected this activity of sketching to creativity in design. As both sketching and idea generation techniques are regarded to be tools for stimulating creativity in design, perhaps combining them can provide an even better tool. <marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> The objective of this paper is to explore whether the functions of sketching as proposed in design research can also be identified in design idea generation meetings.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="48" page="2" column="2">In addition to the individual, cognitive functions of sketching, typical group functions can be identified. The literature on the typical group aspects of sketching is sparse and consists mostly of reports of exploratory investigations. The main efforts for understanding group design are related to design communication, predominantly connected to furthering the field of Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) and human-computer <marker type="page" number="3"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> interaction. The principal interest of this field of research is to allow designers to work together from different locations, by means of computer support. As computers constrict the communication lines available, most research approaches focus on understanding the workspace activity of design groups, e.g. [21][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22" id="41" class="deo:Reference">22</xref>] and experiments which involve limiting the communication lines available, e.g. [1][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18" id="42" class="deo:Reference">18</xref>]. The recognized importance of interaction through sketching and gesturing activity has lead to preliminary CSCW solutions, which show, for instance, the hand of the person drawing, e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1" id="43" class="deo:Reference">1</xref>], in addition to the drawing. One of the topics of interest within the research field of human- computer interaction, is the role of the ‘shared visual context’ in communication, e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9" id="44" class="deo:Reference">9</xref>]. In a design discussion, the shared visual context can be used to make relative references, for instance: ‘let’s combine this with that’, rather than to describe the whole idea when referring to it. This way, relative references provide a more efficient communication process. In CSCW design communication, the use of quickly-drawn sketches in support of group discussions could provide for a more efficient design process by providing a shared visual context. In addition to providing a shared visual context, Scrivener &amp; Clark [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18" id="45" class="deo:Reference">18</xref>] suggest a second role for sketching in collaborative design. In relation to the way in which sketching supports creative group discussion they observe: “The fact that drawings are usually accompanied by verbalizations (in the case of the individual designer this would just be unspoken thought) supports the idea that sketches only partially represent ideas in mind. In general, a drawing act in sketching is not an attempt to represent a solution as such, rather it is a notational device that helps its creator to reason with complex and labile mental structures”. (p.114) According to Scrivener &amp; Clark, sketching provides representations of design solutions that allow for a range of interpretations of elements. By sketching, temporal decisions are made which allow for evaluation and interpretation of a design solution, without excluding alternatives. Finally, besides having the function of communicating and discussing ideas through sketches, the act of sketching itself is regarded important in team design activity. Tang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21" id="46" class="deo:Reference">21</xref>] points out the distinction between the information contained in the artifacts that result from design sketching activity and the information within the activity itself. Relating to his observations from protocol analysis of eight experimental design team meetings, he concludes: “The process of creating and using drawings conveys information not found in the resulting drawings” (p. 150). According to Tang, the act of sketching is a means of communication and attracting attention, as well as it provides a medium for storing information. As with the individual functions of sketching, the function of inviting re-interpretation is especially relevant for the idea<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> generation process, as re-interpretation leads to novel directions for generating ideas.</region>

          <h2 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="49" confidence="possible" page="3" column="2">Sketching Stimulates the Use of Earlier Ideas by Enhancing Their Accessibility.</h2>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="54" page="3" column="2">Sketching may also facilitate archiving and retrieval of design information. According to McKim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10" id="50" class="deo:Reference">10</xref>] building and maintaining a -what he calls- ‘collective graphic memory’ fosters the group’s creative process by providing an easily accessible database of design information, which stimulates building on earlier design ideas. In the design research literature little relevant information can be found concerning this funtion of sketching. However, in the field of visual cognition, differences in recognition of words and pictures have been subject of investigation. This research is relevant for our search, if we consider a sketch to be a type of picture. There is proof that pictures of objects can be categorized more rapidly than words that describe these objects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15" id="51" class="deo:Reference">15</xref>]. But, if the objects from the different categories share many physical characteristics, this advantage of pictures over words may be lost. In that case, categorization for pictures may even be slower than for the word condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19" id="52" class="deo:Reference">19</xref>]. This relates to the depictive qualities of sketches. By sharing actual attributes of the (imaginary or real) object they refer to, sketches provide stronger distinctive features than words. Humphreys &amp; Bruce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7" id="53" class="deo:Reference">7</xref>] hypothesize: “Words representing a particular class of objects will generally bear no greater resemblance to one another than words representing objects from different classes. This is not true for most objects (though there may be exceptions, such as faces). Objects from many natural classes resemble one another more closely than objects from other classes (e.g. many animals resemble one another, as do birds, insects, etc.). It may be that visual processing capitalizes on these family resemblances to optimize cognition”. (p. 285) Other than a few exceptions, words do not share attributes with the actual object that they represent, which means that words lack distinctive features. By having more distinctive features, sketches are more easily recognized among other sketches, which means that sketches facilitate the designers’ access to earlier ideas. Easier access to earlier design ideas is likely to stimulate increased use of these earlier design ideas. So, sketches may enhance the use of information in previously generated design ideas by facilitating the access to these design ideas generated earlier in the process.</region>

      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="20" page="1" column="2">From the design research literature, e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16" id="18" class="deo:Reference">16</xref>], and literature in adjacent relevant fields of research, e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7" id="19" class="deo:Reference">7</xref>], various functions of sketching in design group activity can be identified. If we acknowledge that both informal design group meetings and design brainstorming meetings are problem solving group meetings, then the functions of sketching as found for the design groups can also be applicable for brainstorming meetings in product design. This leads to the following potential functions that sketching may have in design brainstorming meetings:</region>
      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="37" page="1" column="2">The roles of sketching for individual problem solving are still present for the individual designers in a group context. In a review of the research on drawing and design, Purcell &amp; Gero [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16" id="22" class="deo:Reference">16</xref>] focus on the role of sketching in design cognition. This research is mainly concerned with investigating the ways in which the activity of sketching stimulates creativity in design cognition. They point out underlying themes regarding the role of sketching in design. The principal theme deals with the positive role that sketching plays in re-interpretation. A second theme is that re-interpretation provides new knowledge and that this new knowledge leads towards further re-interpretation. Various researchers propose such cyclical models of re-interpretation, each with a slightly different connotation, ranging from a dialectic type of argumentation between seeing-as and seeing-that [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3" id="23" class="deo:Reference">3</xref>], interactive ‘conversations’ with the paper on which the designer draws [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17" id="24" class="deo:Reference">17</xref>], and movement from description to depiction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2" id="25" class="deo:Reference">2</xref>]. In order to provide a broad understanding of this re- interpretative process, the various perspectives will be described briefly. Goldschmidt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3" id="26" class="deo:Reference">3</xref>] observes that architectural designers produce unclear, ambiguous sketches. She suggests that this is a substantial component of creativity in the design process. Designers often use sketches as metaphors for the objects to be<marker type="page" number="2"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> designed. She calls this ‘interactive imagery’, which she defines as: “The simultaneous or almost simultaneous production of a display and the generation of an image that it triggers. Sketching, then, is not merely an act of representation of a preformulated image; in the context we deal with, it is, more often than not, a search for such an image” (p.131). She proposes a dialectic type of argumentation in design. Based on protocol studies Goldschmidt points out that, while making idea sketches, architects use two types of reasoning in rapid oscillation. One type is based on analogical or metaphorical thought, dealing with extracting new meaning from the sketch. She describes this kind of reasoning as ‘seeing as’. The other type, ‘seeing that’, deals with the design consequences of this newly acquired meaning of the sketch. For instance, Goldschmidt provides the following example from her protocol study of a library design task. When observing her sketches over the footprint of the design location, one of the designers sees the surface area as a casbah (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" id="29" class="deo:Reference">figure 1</xref>): “For example, I can imagine this as a casbah...” Then, she extracts knowledge from this analogy, which Goldschmidt refers to as ‘seeing that’: “... where you have territories, confined territories”.<marker type="block"/> Schön and Wiggins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17" id="34" class="deo:Reference">17</xref>] observe that designers develop their products by engaging in an interactive conversation with the paper on which they draw. They describe design as a cyclical process of sketching, interpreting and taking the sketches further. According to them: “Working in some visual medium -drawing, in our examples- the designer sees what is ‘there’ in some representation of a site, draws in relation to it, and sees what has been drawn, thereby informing further designing. In all this ‘seeing’, the designer not only visually registers information, but also constructs its meaning – identifies patterns and gives them meaning beyond themselves”. (p. 135) Another function of sketching identified by Fish &amp; Scrivener [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2" id="35" class="deo:Reference">2</xref>] is that sketching facilitates the transition from general descriptive knowledge into specific depiction. According to Fish &amp; Scrivener the primary reason for designers to sketch is: “...the need to foresee the results of the synthesis or manipulation of objects without actually executing such operations” (p.117). In order to<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> explain the functioning of sketching within design, the authors present a spectrum of visual representations, ranging from purely descriptive symbol systems to purely depictive symbol systems. Descriptive symbol systems can represent whole classes of information: they are abstract and categorical. An example of a descriptive symbol system is natural language. For instance, the word ‘chair’ may represent many different types of seats; sofas, office chairs, TV chairs, rocking chairs, and garden chairs are all covered under the label ‘chair’. The information in such a descriptive symbol system is extrinsic, meaning that the object described by the symbol system is associated with the descriptive system solely by means of external definitions. The word ’chair’ does not contain any of the qualities of the represented objects, neither in structure, color, nor in form. On the other side of the spectrum are depictive symbol systems, which carry all information about the represented objects within themselves, and do not depend on rules for extracting the information from the representation. These symbol systems are concrete and spatially specific, meaning that there is a direct relationship between the spatial position in the medium and the spatial position in the object represented. For instance, a picture of a rocking chair contains the topological information of that object. Depictive representations refer to specific objects, rather than classes of information. According to Fish &amp; Scrivener, sketches have a special set of attributes that help the human mind in translating descriptive propositional information into depictive information. They theorize that in a creative design process this depictive information is then scanned, which leads to new descriptive propositional information, which in turn may be translated into depiction, and so on: “We posit that sketches have the important function of assisting the mind to translate descriptive propositional information into depiction. This depictive information may then be scanned by attentional processes to extract new and perhaps original descriptive information, which in turn can lead to new depiction”. (p.118) The role of facilitating movement from general descriptions towards specific depictions of ideas is more relevant for the later phases of an idea generation process, in which a higher level of resolution is desired. The role of stimulating a re-interpretive cycle could be especially relevant for idea generation meetings, as the general goal of such meetings is to provide a variety of novel ideas.</region>

During brainsketching, participants sketch ideas individually in short rounds. After each round they briefly share their ideas and switch papers. In the next round they use the ideas already present on the worksheet as a source of inspiration. The<marker type="page" number="4"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> brainsketching technique was compared to brainstorming with post-its [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8" id="59" class="deo:Reference">8</xref>], which was selected as a representative of idea generation techniques that use writing as the primary working medium. In each of four experimental meetings both brainsketching and the brainstorming were applied which allowed us to perform a paired comparison analysis of the results for each participant (n=20). Each meeting consisted of five advanced product design students who were involved in a course in facilitating creative problem solving meetings. Each meeting was moderated by an experienced professional creative problem solving facilitator. The participants were asked to generate ideas for products to make traveling by car fun for children. The assignment involved generating ideas for a particular multi-functional family car.</region>

        <h1 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="61" page="4" column="1">METHOD OF ANALYSIS</h1>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="66" page="4" column="1">The main reason for organizing a group meeting is for the group members to interact in their problem solving efforts. This makes the ‘building on each other’s ideas’ guideline for divergent thinking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13" id="62" class="deo:Reference">13</xref>] especially relevant to this research project. Investigating the ways in which the participants build on each other’s ideas provides direct process clues regarding the functioning of the techniques applied. Linkography [4][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="63" class="deo:Reference">5</xref>] is a research approach, which specifically addresses the ways in which designers build on each other’s input. We have adapted this method for application in our research of creative problem solving meetings. In this paper we cannot go into detail regarding the linkography approach. For a more elaborate description we refer to earlier work [23][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24" id="64" class="deo:Reference">24</xref>]. Here we will limit ourselves to a brief description of the general approach, followed by a more in- depth description of the categorizations of links made in the current study. For each idea, direct connections or ‘links’ with all earlier ideas are determined by gathering and evaluating evidence of connections. Evidence can be found within the content of the ideas. Such evidence relates similarities in subject matter found. But evidence can also be found within the context in which the ideas are generated. Such context indicators can consist of among others: gestures or remarks made by the designers when they explain their ideas; physical action when conceiving of the idea; or connecting symbols on the flipcharts. We believe that making explicit use of context indicators while constructing link systems enhances the reliability of linkography as a research method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25" id="65" class="deo:Reference">25</xref>]. For each of the four brainsketching segments and the four brainstorming segments, linking was performed twice by the same person with a time interval of at least one week. The discrepancies between these two link systems were then re- evaluated, which provided the final link system. For verification purposes, an independent judge was asked to fill out a link system for two of the segments. Inter-rater agreement was determined using Cohen’s Kappa. Good levels of agreement were found (K=0.73 and K=0.63) between the link systems of the two raters.</region>

          <h2 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="67" confidence="possible" page="4" column="2">Links as Interactions With ‘External Memory’</h2>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="85" page="4" column="2">Once the link systems were finalized, the links were categorized to reflect structurally different interactions that the designers can have with their earlier ideas. First, a subdivision was made between links that the designers made with their own ideas, which we called ‘individual links’, and links made with each other’s ideas, which we called ‘shared links’. The second subdivision we based on an extension of Newell &amp; Simon’s [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12" id="68" class="deo:Reference">12</xref>] dichotomy of external memory into short-term and remote parts. According to Newell &amp; Simon, there is a distinction between directly available notations, which need to be regarded as an extension of the short-term memory, and notations that need to be searched for. These sub-divisions lead to the following model of a group’s external memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" id="69" class="deo:Reference">figure 2</xref>.):<marker type="block"/> This model provided us with a categorization of four link types that reflect the different interactions of a design group with their notations in ‘external memory’: individual-direct; individual- remote; shared-direct; and, shared-remote. Within a link system, link densities (l.d.) can be determined for these various parts of the group’s external memory, which provide an indicator for the extent to which brainstorming and brainsketching make use of these different parts. The link density consists of the number of links made within one area of external memory, divided by the number of ideas generated. The distinction between the individual and the group aspects of the external memory can easily be identified in a link system. An ‘individual’ link is marked when an idea has a connection with an earlier idea of the same designer. A ‘shared’ link is marked when an idea has a connection with an earlier idea generated by another designer. An operationalization for the distinction between the direct and the remote aspects still needs to be made. Newell &amp; Simon’s working definition of the external part of the short-term memory is “the part of the visual display that is in the subjects foveal view” (p.801). But on the same page, they doubt their assumption: “...it is not clear whether only the instantaneous foveal region can be merged with STM or whether a somewhat larger region, connected by adequately indexed saccades, might<marker type="page" number="5"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> be available” (p. 801). In any case, direct interactions with external memory can be assumed to take place with ideas that do not have to be searched for. These are the ideas that are present within the focus of attention. For the brainsketching segments, the immediate linking area can be considered to contain the ideas that were explained just before the current round of generating ideas started, plus the ideas that the designer is generating him- or herself during the present round of sketching ideas. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" id="73" class="deo:Reference">figure 3</xref> for the resulting representation of the link system, which we refer to as a ‘link matrix’.<marker type="block"/> During brainsketching, the designers generate ideas in parallel. Therefore, it is not likely that there are direct links between ideas generated by different designers within the same round of generating ideas. The designers may sometimes take a peak at the flipcharts of their neighbors, but this was found to occur rarely. In the brainsketching link matrices the areas where linking is highly unlikely to occur are whitened. Of course, within each round of generating ideas, designers can build on their own recently generated ideas, as represented by the single links, or small triangular groups of potential link locations at the diagonal of the link matrix. For brainstorming with post-its the generation of ideas is a continuous group process, which makes it more complicated to provide an operationalization for the direct linking areas in the link matrix. As for brainsketching, the direct linking area ought to cover the link locations with ideas that are still present in the focus of attention. This number needs to be more than seven, because that is supposed to be the average amount of ideas or chunks that the internal short-term memory can contain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11" id="76" class="deo:Reference">11</xref>]. The external notations are supposed to provide an extension to the short-term memory and therefore should contain more than these seven ideas. It cannot be much more than seven ideas, however, because the human attentional focus can only cover a limited number of items, e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14" id="77" class="deo:Reference">14</xref>]. We made the assumption that the<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> direct linking area for the brainstorming segments contains the link locations with the ten previous ideas. The actual direct area may contain a few ideas more or a few ideas less, but the results do not change dramatically when the bandwidth is made a few link locations narrower or wider (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" id="79" class="deo:Reference">figure 4</xref>).<marker type="block"/> For each of these four categories of links, the link-type indices (LTI) were determined. The link-type indices (Supplementary, Modification, and Tangential) provide the distribution of different types of connections that are made within the external memory area, based on a categorization of the nature of ideas provided by Gryskiewicz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="84" class="deo:Reference">6</xref>].

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="99" page="5" column="2">With these results, we can evaluate the three basic functions of sketching in design activity that could have a role in idea generation meetings. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" id="92" class="deo:Reference">figure 5</xref> these basic functions are located in the designer’s interactions with information in the group’s external memory.<marker type="page" number="6"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> Function 1: Sketching Supports an Individual Re- interpretive Cycle. Individual idea generation has a substantial role in the brainsketching process. Compared to brainstorming, ideas had significantly (p&lt;0.005, paired sample t-test) more connections with ideas in the individual-direct area of the external memory (link density for brainsketching, l.d.=0.26, SD=0.13; for brainstorming, l.d.=0.12, SD=0.10). The purported function of sketching in idea generation groups is that the re-interpretation taking place in an idea sketching cycle is said to be conducive to creativity. Purcell &amp; Gero [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16" id="96" class="deo:Reference">16</xref>] describe such re-interpretation as: “the emergence of new ways of seeing the perceptual (drawn) representation of a potential design” (p. 396). Suwa &amp; Tversky [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20" id="97" class="deo:Reference">20</xref>] relate re-interpretation to “ ... acts of shifting the focus of attention” (p. 394). For idea generation meetings, such ‘new ways of seeing’ or ‘focus shifts’, can contribute to the creative process by opening up new directions for further exploration. The level of tangential linking can be seen as an indicator for such creative re-interpretation taking place. Tangential links indicate possible focus shifts, which may be further explored through direct association, identified by modification-type linking, and steps of incremental development, identified by supplementary-type linking. So, a relatively high ratio of tangential links can be seen as a basic indicator that the working medium used supports creativity through re-interpretation. A comparison of the link type indices in the individual-direct area between the brainsketching and brainstorming condition does not show a substantial difference in tangential-type links. For the brainsketching segments, the tangential link type index was only slightly higher (LTI T =0.50, SD=0.0.04) than for brainstorming (LTI T = 0.46, SD=0.20). However, by comparing the link type indices for the area of external memory at hand -the individual direct area- with the overall link type indices, we can evaluate the relative contribution to the creative process of the proposed individual re-interpretive cycle. The link type indices for the links with ideas in the individual-direct area provide a rough indication for the nature of this part of the process.<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> In the individual direct area of the brainsketching segments, a relatively high ratio of tangential linking takes place (LTI T =0.50, SD=0.04), compared to the overall tangential link type index (LTI T = 0.32, SD=0.15). This indicates that in the individual- direct area of external memory a high ratio of wild leap-type connections is made with earlier ideas, which means that the linking in the individual-direct area stimulates creativity by opening novel directions. Function 2: Sketching Invites Re-interpretation of Each Other’s Ideas. Similarly to the previous individual direct function of sketching, the link type indices for the shared-direct area provide some insight into the nature of the connections made with the recently generated ideas of other designers. For both brainstorming and brainsketching the shared-direct area is an important source for making connections (link density for brainsketching l.d.=0.53, SD=0.22; for brainstorming l.d.=0.43, SD=0.17). As in the previously mentioned function of sketches for the individual design process, if sketches stimulate creativity through inviting re-interpretation of each other’s sketches, this should show by a relatively high ratio of tangential links for the brainsketching condition in this area. However, the tangential link type index is substantially lower for brainsketching (LTI T =0.29, SD=0.06) compared to brainstorming (LTI T =0.41, SD=0.04). This is not in line with what one would expect if the creative process were influenced by the proposed function of the designers re-interpreting each other’s idea sketches. Function 3: Sketching Enhances the Accessibility of Earlier Ideas. Because sketches may be easier to identify in the external memory, the designers are more likely to make use of the ideas in the remote area of external memory, which consists of the individual-remote area and the shared-remote area. Comparing the link densities in these areas of external memory for the graphic and for the sentential condition provides a basic indication of whether this function of sketching is relevant for idea generation meetings. The designers made few connections with ideas in the individual remote area of external memory in both conditions. And, there is no substantial difference between the link densities for the individual-remote area (for the graphic condition: l.d.=0.13, SD=0.12; for the sentential condition: l.d.=0.09, SD=0.09). Many more connections are made with the shared-remote area. Here, there is a substantial difference between the link densities. The mean link density in the shared-remote area for the graphic condition (l.d.=0.35; SD=0.22) is significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher in comparison to the sentential condition (l.d.=0.20, SD=0.18). Thus, in the sketching condition, ideas have many more connections with ideas in the shared-remote part of external memory, which supports the notion that brainsketching enhances the creative group process by improving the accessibility of each other’s earlier ideas.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="103" page="7" column="1">Of the three proposed functions of sketching in design groups, no evidence was found in support of the second one, which states that sketches stimulate creativity, by inviting re-interpretation of each other’s idea sketches. It appears that sketches stimulate creativity in idea generation groups, especially in the immediate individual idea generation process by providing new directions for idea generation in an individual generate-interpret cycle. And, sketches may provide a more integrated group process, by providing better access to the earlier ideas, especially in the shared parts of external memory (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" id="102" class="deo:Reference">figure 6</xref>).</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="108" page="7" column="1">The two techniques applied in the experimental meetings were quite different in nature. Brainsketching involved an idea generation process in rounds, whereas brainstorming involved a continuous idea generation process. This means that no generalizations can be made about the functioning of sketching in idea generation meetings. The implications are limited to the differences found between the two techniques. Because of the results of an earlier study [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23" id="106" class="deo:Reference">23</xref>] we could not use an experimental design in which only the working medium was altered. This earlier study showed a break-down of the idea-generation process, if sketching was included in brainstorming, without making structural changes to the technique. The individual function of sketching particularly accounts for why the so-called ‘visual brainstorming’ technique failed in this earlier study. Visual brainstorming was a direct variation to brainstorming with post-its. Designers were asked to sketch ideas on individual sheets of paper and, when done with a sketch, immediately share the idea with the group, whereupon the facilitator pasted the sheet with the idea sketch onto the flipchart. This technique did not allow for the individual idea generation cycle, in which new search directions can be found. Indeed, the technique not only lacked quantity of ideas (only 17 ideas were generated, compared to 46 for the control condition, in which regular brainstorming was applied), but the tangential link index was also especially low for visual brainstorming (LTI T =0.21, compared to LTI T =0.46 for regular brainstorming), indicating few<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> new connections that could open up novel directions for generating ideas. Apparently, even when involved in an idea generation meeting, participants need to be allowed -or even stimulated- to engage in individual cycles of re-interpretation. The brainsketching technique applied in this study makes sure of this by means of formal rounds of individual idea generation. Perhaps other ways are possible in which the participants can make more informal shifts between the re-interpretive cycle of their individual sketching process, and making connections in the group process.</region>
