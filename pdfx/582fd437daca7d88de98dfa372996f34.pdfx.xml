      <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="40" page="1" column="1">In the past 20 years there has been a growing concern for children in HCI. This has led to the establishment of child– computer interaction (CCI) as a distinct research discipline, and engaging children in the design of interactive technology is a core issue in CCI. Druin’s seminal work on Cooperative Inquiry [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1" id="13" class="deo:Reference">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2" id="14" class="deo:Reference">2</xref>] and the Scandinavian approach to Participatory Design (PD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3" id="15" class="deo:Reference">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4" hidden="1" id="16" class="deo:Reference">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="17" class="deo:Reference">5</xref>] have gained wide acceptance as methods for engaging the younger generations in design work. In these studies, and in CCI literature in general, attention is paid primarily to children aged 3–12, whereas older children, the teenagers, are not addressed as a distinct user group. Fitton et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="18" class="deo:Reference">6</xref>] characterize teenagers not as an age group, but by key traits associated with teenagers. According to Fitton et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="19" class="deo:Reference">6</xref>], teenagers share a desire for independence, autonomy, association with peers, and a willingness to take risks. Moreover, compared to younger children, teenagers experience an increasing disassociation from parents and guardians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="20" class="deo:Reference">6</xref>]. According to Mazzone et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7" id="21" class="deo:Reference">7</xref>], these distinct traits are also reflected in the way teenagers engage with PD projects. In comparison to younger children, teenagers have low motivation for engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7" id="22" class="deo:Reference">7</xref>]. Echoing Mazzone, Fitton et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="23" class="deo:Reference">6</xref>] emphasize the need for more research on teenagers, especially studies of teenagers as informants or design partners. In this paper, we propose a theoretical<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> framework for understanding teenagers’ motivation. The issue of motivation for participation has always been at the core of PD. In the 1970s, Scandinavian PD began as a result of research projects with workers who analyzed the effects of the introduction of IT at their workplaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8" id="29" class="deo:Reference">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9" hidden="1" id="30" class="deo:Reference">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10" hidden="1" id="31" class="deo:Reference">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11" id="32" class="deo:Reference">11</xref>]. Ehn described this as the design of emancipatory practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8" id="33" class="deo:Reference">8</xref>], emphasizing that ‘democracy’, ‘quality of work’ and ‘skilfulness’ are at the core of every PD practice. As Ehn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12" id="34" class="deo:Reference">12</xref>] states: ‘‘A complementary reason for participation, and in the long run probably the strongest motivation for its use in many organizations, was to ensure that existing skills could be made a resource in the design process’’ [12, p. 94]. As PD gained wider acceptance outside industrial settings, the political ideals of democracy, quality of work, and skilfulness were maintained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13" id="35" class="deo:Reference">13</xref>]. However, the motivation for engaging in PD processes differs significantly between 1970s industrial settings and current, new PD venues, such as schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="36" class="deo:Reference">5</xref>], libraries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14" id="37" class="deo:Reference">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15" id="38" class="deo:Reference">15</xref>], and museums [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16" id="39" class="deo:Reference">16</xref>]. By analyzing a case study in which teenagers were engaged as design partners, we explore a range of tools available to PD researchers and designers to support teenagers’ motivation. We use ‘tools’ broadly, as both material and immaterial artefacts used in the design process to support teenagers’ motivation. The pa- per is structured as follows: First, we review existing literature on teenagers in PD, and examine how designers currently support teenagers’ motivation in PD; second, we provide a theoretical ac- count of teenagers’ hierarchy of motives, based on studies in de- velopmental psychology. Based on this theoretical grounding, we analyse a case study of ten PD workshops with teenagers. We pro- pose seven different tools for supporting teenagers’ engagement in</region>

        <h1 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="44" page="2" column="1">Teenagers as design partners</h1>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="68" page="2" column="1">In popular literature, teenagers are understood as children of the ages spanning 13–19 years. In developmental psychology, teenagers are primarily described by the changes that emerge as a result of developing an individual identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17" id="45" class="deo:Reference">17</xref>]. These changes may be described in terms of cognitive, psychological, and social circumstances, but cultural changes are also likely to affect the teenager’s development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17" id="46" class="deo:Reference">17</xref>]. In HCI literature, teenagers have so far not been given much attention. In their seminal work on children in HCI, Bruckman and Bandlow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18" id="47" class="deo:Reference">18</xref>] describe teenagers’ thinking as generally similar to that of adults. They state that designing for teenagers is much less challenging because designers can at least partially rely on their own intuition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18" id="48" class="deo:Reference">18</xref>]. Bruckman and Bandlow draw heavily on Piaget’s stage theory, which is related to cognitive changes in the human mind from infancy to adolescence. Both Blaye, Ackerman, and Light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19" id="49" class="deo:Reference">19</xref>] and Iversen and Brodersen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20" id="50" class="deo:Reference">20</xref>] discuss the limitation of building an understanding of children and teenagers solely on cognitive theory. When integrating more socio-cultural aspects of teenagers’ lives into the design process, teenagers stand out as a distinct user group. Danielsson and Wiberg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21" id="51" class="deo:Reference">21</xref>] argue that the participation of teenagers in design (of educational games) is crucial, as teenagers’ values and motivation for using technology are difficult, perhaps even impossible, for designers to predict. Fitton et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="52" class="deo:Reference">6</xref>] suggest that more research is needed, in terms of actively involving teenagers in research and design projects, especially when it comes to actively involving teenagers in the design process as informants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22" id="53" class="deo:Reference">22</xref>] and design partners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23" id="54" class="deo:Reference">23</xref>]. Fitton et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="55" class="deo:Reference">6</xref>] definition of teenagers goes beyond age to include social and cultural aspects of transformation from childhood to adolescence, such as the desire for independence and increasing dissociation from parents or guardians. Fitton et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="56" class="deo:Reference">6</xref>] identify a range of research questions when designing with teenagers, one being, which methods and techniques actively engage teenagers in PD. Having conducted a PD project with teenagers, Marzzone et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7" id="57" class="deo:Reference">7</xref>] summarize the challenges faced when designing with teenagers as active participants. In spite of their use of well-known PD tools and techniques, they found that teenagers have a short attention span, low motivation, critical behaviour, and unpredictable attendance, in comparison to other design partners in PD projects. Regarding the PD techniques that have been used to engage teenagers through PD, Katterfeldt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24" id="58" class="deo:Reference">24</xref>] review a number of existing user-centred design techniques when applied to designing with teenagers. They conclude that teenagers are open for co-design, but that existing techniques need to be further developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24" id="59" class="deo:Reference">24</xref>]. Specific approaches and experiences are also reported in the literature. Edwards, McDonald, and Zhao [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25" id="60" class="deo:Reference">25</xref>] motivated teenagers to engage in co-design by rewarding them gift certificates worth £100, and Toth et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26" id="61" class="deo:Reference">26</xref>] engaged teenagers in their project through the use of multiple methods, including the use of diaries. Alvarado [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27" id="62" class="deo:Reference">27</xref>] describes the Embodied Narratives technique, in which they boosted children’s motivation through fun, spontaneous, and open-ended tasks, and Horton et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28" id="63" class="deo:Reference">28</xref>] introduce a range of teenage personas to engage teenagers in reflections on ‘coolness’. Moraveji et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29" id="64" class="deo:Reference">29</xref>] explore how Comic boarding (as compared to conventional storyboarding) engages teenagers (and children in general) in early-stage design activities. More generally, several authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4" id="65" class="deo:Reference">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24" id="66" class="deo:Reference">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30" id="67" class="deo:Reference">30</xref>] point out the fact that ownership and ‘expertness’ encourage teenagers to commit to the PD process. Our aim is to explore how various tools may be employed to engage teenagers in PD activities. In the following section we begin by proposing a Cultural–Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) approach’ to teenagers’ motives and motivation. The purpose of this theoretical framework is to provide the basis for an analysis of various tools for supporting teenagers’ motivation in PD Work.</region>

      <section class="deo:Motivation">
        <h1 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="69" page="2" column="2">2. Motivation</h1>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="88" page="2" column="2">Our understanding of motivation is derived from CHAT, emphasizing how people’s development progresses through their engagement with cultural artefacts and institutions. As cultural values are crystallized in the artefacts and practices of the central institutions of society, and since personal development takes place through participation in these institutions, cultural values become conditions for the individual’s development [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31" id="70" class="deo:Reference">31</xref>]. In particular, we build on studies within CHAT [32,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31" id="71" class="deo:Reference">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32" id="72" class="deo:Reference">32</xref>,31, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33" id="73" class="deo:Reference">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34" hidden="1" id="74" class="deo:Reference">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35" id="75" class="deo:Reference">35</xref>] that explore motivation as a relational phenomenon emerging in the transactions between people and cultural institutions. The CHAT perspective corresponds well to existing theoretical understandings of children and teenagers in HCI, as proposed by Blaye, Ackerman, and Light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19" id="76" class="deo:Reference">19</xref>], and Iversen and Brodersen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20" id="77" class="deo:Reference">20</xref>]. Hedegaard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36" id="78" class="deo:Reference">36</xref>] distinguishes between motivation and motives. Motivation may be understood as the dynamic that characterizes a person’s engagement in a particular situation. By observing how teenagers tinker with a new iPad application, texting friends or vis- iting a museum, we can see how their motivation may increase and decrease in particular situations. Whereas motivation is sit- uated and context sensitive, teenagers are driven by more funda- mental and cross-situational factors, which Hedegaard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36" id="79" class="deo:Reference">36</xref>] term ‘motives’. Hedegaard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28" id="80" class="deo:Reference">28</xref>] suggest that motives are the goals that shape a person’s engagement in particular activities over an extended period of time. Whereas a particular situation or design might attract our attention in a given situation, motives describe more enduring interests and preferences. Motives are de- veloped through people’s participation in social and cultural in- stitutions, and thus reflect the values and practices embedded in these institutions, which are appropriated by the individual. Em- phasizing the formation of motives as a process of appropriation, El’konin explores how motives are developed through childhood as a function of the central institutions in which the child or teenager participates, such as family, friends, or school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33" id="81" class="deo:Reference">33</xref>]. Extending this coupling of motives and institutional engagement, Hedegaard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34" id="82" class="deo:Reference">34</xref>] suggests that motives are structured in a hierarchy of meaning- ful and stimulating motives. At any given time, some meaningful motives will be dominant. The dominant motives are associated with the types of activities that are central and most important to a person’s life, reflecting their primary institutional engagement. For pre-schoolers, dominating motives typically revolve around play, and for school children, dominating motives are typically con- nected to the exploration of roles and being like the adults. For teenagers, dominating motives are typically related to acceptance by peers and being ‘someone of consequence’. By being someone of consequence, Hedegaard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33" id="83" class="deo:Reference">33</xref>] points out that teenagers are con- stantly engaged in the process of finding their roles in society, in relation to friends, professions, identity, and in their striving to be successful. Dominant motives are always meaningful, but a number of other meaningful motives may be present without being dominant. As an example, teens may still have motives connected to learning and play that are meaningful, regardless of their dominant motive being social acceptance. A stimulating motive is a motive that is meaningful in a different context, but is placed into a new context in which it can motivate the new activity. Stimulating motives are often used in educational contexts to start an activity that is not itself motivating. This theoretical approach to motives has previously been discussed in interaction design research by Stenild &amp; Iversen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37" id="84" class="deo:Reference">37</xref>]. The structuring of motives in a hierarchy means that the dominating motives are superior to other motives, and thus influence how the multi-motivated activities are acted out. As an example, the dominating motive of teenagers (acceptance by peers) is superior to any stimulating motive (e.g. technology usage), and will influence how the teenager engages in technology<marker type="page" number="3"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> usage. The hierarchy of motives offers a way of understanding and levelling different tools for supporting teenagers’ motivation in PD. Our aim is to analyse how different tools used in PD processes resonate with the theoretical understanding of motives and motivation presented here. Next, we present our methodological approach to the study of PD processes with teenagers.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="103" page="3" column="1">Our methodological approach to studying teenagers’ motiva- tion for engagement in PD derives from recent work in HCI and CCI. Lazar, Feng, and Hochheiser [ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38" id="90" class="deo:Reference">38</xref>] provide a thorough account of how different qualitative studies are conducted in the broader field of HCI, arguing that often, the strongest results come when using different methods to study the same phenomenon in differ- ent locations and settings. Guha et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39" id="91" class="deo:Reference">39</xref>] bring the methodological concern to CCI by providing a rich set of considerations of how to study the impact of the design process on the children involved.<marker type="block"/> 3.1. Research method Our study is aimed at understanding how designers motivate teenagers to engage in PD. Guha et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39" id="93" class="deo:Reference">39</xref>] stress that one should not artificially create a technology design for the sole purpose of studying the effects of participation. Rather, the research should be conducted in parallel to other research preformed by the design team. Thus, our study was incorporated into an ongoing design research project, which took place in two school environments, involving 13- to 14-year-olds (see below). As the study of design processes (in this case, design with teenagers) is a complex task with many variables, Guha et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39" id="94" class="deo:Reference">39</xref>] suggest that qualitative methods are the best ways to study social phenomena such as PD processes involving children. Although time-consuming, the pay- off of conducting case studies includes rich descriptions, surprising findings, and in-depth understanding. We chose to conduct a case study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40" id="95" class="deo:Reference">40</xref>] combining observations from 10 PD sessions with teenagers over a time span of eight months. The duration of each workshop was approximately 3 h, and each workshop was conducted in a school setting. Seven workshops were conducted in, Denmark, and three workshops took place in Germany. Each workshop utilized established PD tools and techniques, such as storyboarding, mock-up sessions, and collaborative prototyping. A thorough description of the PD process may be found in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30" id="96" class="deo:Reference">30</xref>].<marker type="block"/> 3.2. Research process One of the co-authors acted as a participant observer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41" id="98" class="deo:Reference">41</xref>] during the design workshops, while others facilitated them. Participant observation is a technique often used in PD to study a particular user group (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42" id="99" class="deo:Reference">42</xref>]). Here, we used the technique to enquire into the ongoing dynamic of a PD project in which designers used different tools for engaging teenagers in the design process. In our study, the participant observer had access to the entire design process, from the initial planning of the workshops to the final debriefing session among the participating designers and researchers. Observations from the workshops were documented in field notes and pictures. The field notes were used as a tool for the debriefing session immediately after each design session. Here, the research team, and in some sessions, teachers and children, too, reflected on the activities as they occurred. Occasionally, the teachers and children were able to provide more insight into the observations. For instance, the observer noted that when the t- shirts (handed out by the designers) were customized before use, the pupils provided an account of this behaviour. They liked the fact that the t-shirts gave them a role in the research project, but on the other hand, they did not want the t-shirts to be uniforms. During the debriefing sessions, field notes were confirmed and sometimes adjusted according to input and reflections from teachers and teenagers.<marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> During the workshops we were able to identify various tools for engaging teenagers in the design process. These tools (and the situations in which they were used) were analyzed and organized using affinity diagramming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43" id="102" class="deo:Reference">43</xref>] to categorize the tools in relation to how they motivated the teenagers. The participant observer and one of the researchers conducted the analysis. Below, we present the outcome of this analysis, but first, we provide a short introduction to the case study.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="107" page="3" column="2">The Narrify project was a ten-month project that took place in the autumn of 2012. The objective was to develop a new so- cial technology application and an augmented school installation to support informal learning at state schools. Narrify was an in- terdisciplinary research project involving two interaction design- ers, an anthropologist, two architects and a pedagogical expert. The project also included two industrial partners specializing in the de- sign of augmented learning environments for schools. The devel- opment of the Narrify application and two interactive installations were conducted as a PD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3" id="105" class="deo:Reference">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4" id="106" class="deo:Reference">4</xref>] process with ten key workshop activ- ities. The project mainly involved pupils (aged 13–15) from three different state schools. Each workshop engaged 16–80 pupils and 5–10 teachers and school administrators. All in all, about 150 pupils and 25 teachers and administrators took part in the Narrify project for longer or shorter periods of time. The outcome of the project, the Narrify application, is a social technology that runs in a web browser, on tablets and smartphones. The application promotes knowledge sharing aimed at providing pupils, parents, and teachers with a digital context for exchanging formal and informal knowledge. Moreover, Narrify is integrated into two physical installations in which pupils and teachers can engage with the Narrify software. Rather than going into detail about the entire process, the following section describes how the designers worked to motivate the teenagers to participate in the PD process. Based on participatory observations, we have identified seven categories that describe the tools used in the process: rewards, storytelling, identification, collaboration, endorsement, technology, and performance. In this context, the term ‘tool’ refers to the instruments accessible to the designers to motivate teenagers to participate in the design process.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="109" page="3" column="2">The ‘reward’ category contains all material goods that were given to the teenagers to make the design interventions a con- venient and pleasant experience. In all ten workshops, teenagers were offered refreshments such as fruit, sweets, beverages, sand- wiches, and cookies. All participants including the designers shared and consumed the refreshments during the workshops. In the ini- tial stage of the design process, all participants were also given a t-shirt, a key strap, and a name tag as part of the partici- pants’ personal project kits. The teenagers were informed that they could keep these items after the process had ended. On two oc- casions, the designers rewarded some of the teenagers with tick- ets to the local cinema. Two girls made a survey of the number of smartphones, tablets, and laptops among all 6th graders (75 interviewees) at their school. The survey was uploaded to the shared Facebook site for others to study. At another school, three teenagers provided a detailed, written account of their concep- tion of one particular design workshop, in which the teenagers had worked with programmers and architects in a prototyping session. They were all rewarded with cinema tickets to reward their effort in the project.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="113" page="4" column="1">Storytelling was used as a tool to motivate the teenagers on several occasions during the project. By storytelling, we refer to how teenagers were provided with an opportunity to communicate their own experiences and accounts to a broader audience. During the initial workshops, all teenagers were encouraged to produce a storyboard and share their best learning experiences with other participants. One teenage girl happily told others about a particular learning experience in which she had shown pictures of her new puppy as part of a school class. A teenage boy explained that his best learning experience was an occasion in which he and his teachers were learning together about technology. In another workshop, the teenagers started a process on new, blended learning spaces by recording two-minute videos of their favourite places in the school (the gym, the school yard, the cinema etc.), explaining why this place was particularly interesting to them.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="115" page="4" column="1">All workshops in the Narrify project contained an element of digital technology. Facebook was used as a shared platform to communicate among participants, as the children (and their parents) were familiar with Facebook, and had personal profiles on the social network. Designers brought iPads, iPhones, WIFI access, laptops, and airprint-enabled printers to the workshops to support the collaborative work, and to motivate the children to engage in the process. The teenagers were drawn to the technology, and continuously tinkered with the technology provided during the workshops. During a workshop in which designers wanted to gain a better understanding of the existing school environment, teenagers used digital cameras to document their understanding of the school campus. By taking pictures and using WIFI and airprint to access the printer, the participants seamlessly provided photo coverage from around the school. The digital infrastructure supported the workshop agenda, but more importantly, the digital technology and the working format motivated the teenagers to actively engage in the workshop themes. During workshop breaks, teenagers engaged with the technology, uploading pictures on the project’s Facebook site—and to go online, play games, and communicate with friends in online social communities such as Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="117" page="4" column="1">As mentioned earlier, all teenagers participating in the Narrify workshops were provided with a t-shirt, key strap, and name tag, and given access to the project’s Facebook site. With respect to identification, each teenager was provided with a project identity card, through which they could communicate their commitment to the project to others. Interestingly, the teenagers were particularly happy to receive a fairly neutral, white t-shirt with the project logo printed on the front, and a project statement on the back. At one particular school, the t-shirt was happily worn by all participants, but in a very customized fashion. Some teenagers tore off the sleeves, as they wanted to express a certain style. Others started to decorate the t-shirts with statements, stickers, and Post-it R notes expressing their loyalty to particular sports clubs or brand names. It was observed that this kind of identification as both a project team member and an individual was important, and motivated the teenagers to participate in the workshops.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="120" page="4" column="1">Collaboration with other teenagers, and in general, was used as a tool for engaging the teenagers in the design process. Every workshop had an element of teamwork, with a shared mission to <marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> accomplish. In several instances, different roles were organized to support the group dynamic among the participants. When recording future scenarios on iPhones, one or two participants played out the scenario while another recorded it, and the last group member directed the others according to a storyboard. In general, collaboration was important for the motivation of the teenagers. In most instances, collaborative activities supported the participants’ motivation, but at times, the opposite was also the case. In these instances, personal relationships among the teenagers obscured the workshop activities. To some extent, the participating teachers were able to provide the designers with input on how these conflicts could be resolved.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="122" page="4" column="2">One of the less material ways of motivating the teenagers to en- gage in the design work was the use of endorsements throughout the entire design process. As an introduction to the project, the lead designer introduced the PD project and underlined the importance of teenagers being the experts in the design process. As a conse- quence, the teenagers were admitted to all on-site design activities, such as workshop planning, workshop participation, debriefing sessions, and decision-making. The legitimate access to all project phases and facilities was a motivating factor for the teenagers. Moreover, during design sessions, teenagers were encouraged to take part in the discussions with school administrators and other authorities. The teenagers did not choose to engage in workshop planning activities. However, they did take on responsibilities that were not initiated by the researchers. As an example, two girls vol- untarily initiated a survey on personal devices among their friends (as described in Section 4.1), and posted the results on Facebook.</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="124" page="4" column="2">Performing in front of other teenagers is both highly motivating and extremely demanding for many teenagers. By emphasizing a safe and secure setting in the debriefing sessions during which the project participants accounted for their efforts, designers motivated the teenagers to take the stage during these sessions. Despite the pressure of performing in front of strangers, and more importantly, close peers, the teenagers were highly motivated to make these public presentations. On some occasions, teenagers acted out future scenarios in front of 75 invited guests. In other cases, the teenagers communicated their viewpoints and conceptions regarding the ongoing project activities to invited experts and researchers.</region>

        <h1 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="125" page="4" column="2">5. Discussion</h1>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="133" page="4" column="2">As proposed in a previous section, CHAT offers a vocabulary for understanding the dynamics of teenagers’ motivation and hierarchy of motives. By observing the teenagers during the workshop, we observed that they were motivated to engage in PD work by receiving different kind of rewards, engaging in collaborative activities, using props to prime their identities, performing in front of peers, being endorsed by others, by using novel technology, and by telling stories about their everyday lives. However, the durability and effect of these different tools for motivation varied significantly. At one school, the reward of free t-shirts was highly appreciated, and made the children engage actively with the shared design tasks. At other workshops in different school environments, the same t-shirts were not considered interesting, and did not cause the same engagement among teenagers. Some teenagers were highly motivated by being endorsed as experts, others were not particularly intrigued by this encouragement to take ownership of the project. Our observations indicate clearly that tools to engage teenagers in the <marker type="page" number="5"/><marker type="column" number="1"/><marker type="block"/> PD process are highly dependent on how the tools are appropriated and valued in the relationships between the teenagers. This process of appropriation and negotiation is not only related to the teenagers acting in the design situation, but may be understood in relation to the teenagers’ hierarchy of motives. As presented earlier, Hedegaard’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33" id="129" class="deo:Reference">33</xref>] conception of dominant, meaningful, and stimulating motives provides a framework in which to understand the various tools that were employed during the Narrify workshops. Hedegaard suggests that the dominating motives found among teenagers typically revolve around their social acceptance and position in relation to peers. Endorsements, performances, and collaboration resonate in various ways with this overarching category of motives. During the workshops, it was observed that the teenagers were indeed motivated by being endorsed, and that this motivation seemed to sustain their engagement for extended periods of time, compared to being served refreshments, for example. Performances and storytelling also worked well as tools for motivating the teenagers, particularly in instances where stories or performances were shared with their close peers. At times, the performances had such a strong effect that the performance itself moved the focus from the object of the design activity. This is a general concern from the observation of the various tools, that it is vital to establish and maintain links between the tools used to motivate teenagers and the design task at hand. Moving to the other end of the continuum, Hedegaard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34" id="130" class="deo:Reference">34</xref>] suggests that stimulating motives are motives that were previously meaningful or that are meaningful in another context. Moreover, Hedegaard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34" id="131" class="deo:Reference">34</xref>] argues that these are often used to get activities started. This was also observed in relation to the various forms of rewards and technology. Sandwiches and sweets typically worked for gathering the teenagers and creating a bit of enthusiasm around the activities to come. Of course, once pupils became familiar with the technology and had eaten their sandwiches, this engagement tended to fade. However, a noteworthy observation is the fact that although we might think of the rewards as primarily being stimulating in nature, the teenagers tended to bring these into situations that reflected dominating motives. As an example, at some schools the t-shirt was seen as a cheap attempt to motivate teenagers to do the work of the designers. Accordingly, the t-shirt (as a stimulating tool) had almost no effect on the teenagers’ engagement during the workshop. In other cases, our t-shirts were personalized and annotated with statements and band names. Here, the t-shirts became an interface for communicating personal preferences and friendships. In a sense, the t-shirts were appropriated as a tool for communicating identity and relationships, which is a central category of dominating motives among most teenagers. The example of the appropriation of the t-shirts illustrates a general dynamic in the relationship between the tools provided by designers and the teenagers’ motives. Things that were intended to serve as stimulating tools were often appropriated by the teenagers to fit their dominant motives. Another aspect is the way in which various tools work in concert. As an example, providing teenagers with novel technology sometimes served to engage them in collaborations with one another, or to engage in storytelling. In this sense, various tools can work in concert to motivate. What we have provided here is an analysis of various types of tools that we have employed in the Narrify project to engage teenagers in PD. By doing this, we support efforts (Fitton et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="132" class="deo:Reference">6</xref>]) to establish teen–computer interaction as an emerging field of research.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="136" page="5" column="1">The contribution of this paper to the CCI community is two-fold. First, a CHAT-based account of the formation of motives provides <marker type="column" number="2"/><marker type="block"/> a way of articulating issues of motivation and engagement both with designed products and within the design process. The CHAT perspective provides a view of motives as products of peoples’ par- ticipation in socio-cultural institutions, and the way in which the values embedded in these shape individual development. In this paper we have pursued the CHAT perspective in relation to the design process, but we suggest that it is equally useful when un- derstanding how children use and appropriate technology. Second, the seven overarching categories presented in this paper proved (in various ways) to support teenagers’ motivation during the set of workshops. The categories are not exhaustive, but resonate well with existing literature on CCI, ranging from paying teenagers to participate (rewards), to embodied narratives (performance and storytelling), to more subtle forms of communicating ownership and expertness (endorsements). In fact, established tools and tech- niques of CCI and PD in general already support these different cat- egories. In our analysis we demonstrated how a CHAT perspective on the formation of motives may be a resource for understanding not only how individual tools support motivation, but also a re- source for understanding how children appropriate these tools in relation to their dominating motives, and how various tools work in concert to support motivation. We suggest that the CHAT per- spective may be a valuable approach for discussing how tools and techniques from the existing PD toolbox may be used to engage teenagers in a PD process.</region>
