        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="27" page="2" column="1">Successful product development deals effectively with information costs. A crucial consideration of conventional market research is concerned with how to economize on the acquisition of reliable need-related information that allows product developers to create exactly the products consumers want. Product developers, however, face the problem that need-related information is inherently ambiguous – consumers may not be able to articulate their needs clearly (von <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28" id="19" class="deo:Reference">Hippel, 1986</xref>), or their needs may change as they proceed to use a given product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20" id="20" class="deo:Reference">Rosenberg, 1982</xref>). Von <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26" id="21" class="deo:Reference">Hippel (1998)</xref> argued for an alternative task partitioning between users and producers as a possible way of bypassing information acquisition for product development. The idea has now been concretized in the notion of “user toolkits for innovation” (von <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27" id="22" class="deo:Reference">Hippel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23" id="23" class="deo:Reference">Thomke and von Hippel 2002</xref>; von <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="24" class="deo:Reference">Hippel and Katz, 2002</xref>) in which the solution is simply to offer consumers the tools to customize essential parts of products themselves. This leaves some essential problem-solving activities up to consumers, which in turn may call for renewed considerations concerning the organization of new product development. Observations indicate that the user toolkit method is not just a matter of interest for researchers: toolkits have for some time been offered by leading firms to their consumers. Examples range from Nestle’s ingredients toolkit, enabling chefs of Mexican food to create customized food solutions, to Westwood Studio’s software toolkits, permitting computer gamers to design key game features by themselves. The research question addressed in the present paper is: can we expect consumers to be capable of the design-related problem solving needed and of handling the new tools; what are the implications for firms of letting consumers take over design tasks? As researchers paint a positive picture of the prospects of the toolkit approach, there is a need to answer these questions. The paper focuses on the relation between toolkit use and the amount of support and supervision that firms provide their consumers with. An analysis of the relationship between products grouped on the basis of their “opportunities for consumer involvement” (OCI) characteristic and the factual amount of support that consumers receive in these product groups is carried out on the basis of 78 observations from the computer games industry. The results show that higher support rates are experienced in consumer groups<marker type="page" number="3"/><marker type="block"/> that have toolkits. This result suggests that some of the “savings” on information costs in the product development department achieved by the toolkit method will eventually reemerge as costs in consumer support. Along these lines I will argue that whereas it might be possible to equip consumers with toolkits, it is not, at least not at the outset, likely that they are endowed with the appropriate design capabilities needed to handle the new tools and to undertake complex innovation tasks. Learning is needed in the consumer domain before customization processes can take off. One source of learning is the training that toolkit providers offer via their support and supervision. An alternative (and attractive) source of learning for toolkit use is one that takes place on a consumer-to-consumer basis. Observations and experiences from the computer games industry illuminate some potentially effective solutions to the need for consumer learning, and outline how an important dynamic can be added to the toolkit approach that improves its usefulness.</region>

        <h1 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="28" confidence="possible" page="3" column="1">2. The information problem of modern product development</h1>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="38" page="3" column="1">To solve a problem, needed information and problem solving capabilities must be brought together – virtually or physically at a single locus. To the product developer, the identification of users needs is an essential undertaking, which however, is constrained by some essential costs of acquiring the relevant information. Product developers will soon face the problem that users locally hold an essential, but rather sticky portion of information required for product development. Von <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25" id="29" class="deo:Reference">Hippel (1994)</xref> defines “sticky information” as “the information that is costly to acquire, transfer, and use in a new location”. The degree of stickiness is defined as the incremental expenditure required to transfer a certain unit of information to a specified locus in a form that is useable to the information seeker. When this cost is low information stickiness is low; when it is high stickiness is high (ibid.). High information stickiness may be due to the attributes of information itself, such as the way in which information is encoded (Nelson 1982, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17" id="30" class="deo:Reference">Pavitt 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20" id="31" class="deo:Reference">Rosenberg, 1982</xref>); alternatively it may be a function of the absorptive capacity of information seekers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1" id="32" class="deo:Reference">Cohen and Levinthal, 1990</xref>). For both these interconnected reasons users’ need-related information is frequently highly sticky, which means that the information called upon by product developers can only be swapped at high costs. Adding<marker type="page" number="4"/><marker type="block"/> to those costs is the fact that user’s needs will typically change during the use process; issues will appear that the user did not realize prior to use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20" id="35" class="deo:Reference">Rosenberg, 1982</xref>), thus requiring several information iterations between consumers and product developers during development processes before a satisfactory product concept can be reached. Furthermore, a general trend toward more heterogeneous consumer needs on important markets makes product development increasingly difficult (von <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27" id="36" class="deo:Reference">Hippel, 2001</xref>). Recent research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="37" class="deo:Reference">Franke and von Hippel, 2002</xref>) concerning this issue concludes that as a consequence of lacking methods to deal with need-heterogeneity about 50% of the total variation in consumer needs will typically be left unaddressed in with-in segment variation.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="40" page="4" column="1">There are various ways for firms to approach the problem of dealing with need-related information for product development. A generic feature of any product development approach is the degree to which and way in which consumers are involved.

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="47" page="4" column="1">The weakest form of OCI limits the role of the consumer in product development to being a simple information provider who delivers feedback voluntarily or when asked to do so by market researchers. In this approach the more a company knows about a specific consumer need, the better the possibilities of satisfying those needs. Various sub-methods pertain to the conventional “listening to consumers approach”. The approach covers a number of highly diffused methods, which lie at the heart of conventional market research approaches to product development (in which the firm must be the proactive part in collecting need- related-information). From the perspective of the firm, listening to complaints may make it possible for the firm to approximate a more appropriate product or service. Collecting consumer complaint data is a common practice in many companies. Research has focused on processes to handle complaints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22" id="42" class="deo:Reference">Tax, Brown, and Chandrashekaran 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5" id="43" class="deo:Reference">Fornell and Westbrook 1984</xref>; Resnick and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18" id="44" class="deo:Reference">Harmon 1983</xref>), the customers' experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21" id="45" class="deo:Reference">Smith, Bolton, and Wagner 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10" id="46" class="deo:Reference">Hansen, Powers and Swan 1997</xref>), and the relationship to important</region>

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="55" page="5" column="1">business outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19" id="50" class="deo:Reference">Richins 1983</xref>). Further, interviews and focus group approaches fall within this category: these methods are often used in practice and have received a considerable amount of research attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8" id="51" class="deo:Reference">Greenbaum 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12" id="52" class="deo:Reference">Holstein and Gubrium 1995</xref>). They are most often used to understand consumers’ expectations and to determine consumers’ views on the importance of particular product attributes. Sophisticated market researchers employ them at the end of surveys to add insight into quantitative results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29" id="53" class="deo:Reference">Woodruff and Gardial 1996</xref>). With more complex product offerings, focus groups are used to gain an in-depth evaluation of these offerings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13" id="54" class="deo:Reference">Krueger 1994</xref>). Focus groups are often used to validate internally generated product ideas, and are occasionally used at the idea generation stage just after the prototype stage. The crucial question here is one of the costs versus the benefits of the information gained through these methods. The utility of such methods depends on the analyst’s ability to accurately and completely condense from the interview data the attributes which consumers feel are important in the products or what it is precisely they want to express by their complaints etc. The methods suffer from the sticky information problem: the expenditure required to transfer a given unit of information from one place to another in a form useable for the information seeker is high. Listening to consumers may simply be too costly and the surveys do not usually elicit enough response or information - factors, which may help explain why these research techniques are often abandoned (Day, 1994).</region>

          <h2 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="56" confidence="possible" page="5" column="1">Interaction with advanced users: a moderate form of consumer involvement</h2>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="62" page="5" column="1">Moving towards increasing OCI, we identify the “interaction with advanced users approach”. Advanced users include “lead users” who are defined as being “users whose present strong needs will become general in the market place months or years in the future” (von <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28" id="57" class="deo:Reference">Hippel, 1986</xref>) and “expert testers” who are those that typically are able to spots errors and mistakes in prototypes during testing. The key characteristics of these users are interest in and, frequent use of the developer’s products. They are frequently dedicated individuals who make extensive use of the product in question and are familiar with its features. The value for product developers of interacting with advanced lead users and expert testers has been highlighted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11" id="58" class="deo:Reference">Herstatt and von Hippel (1992)</xref>: advanced users’ focused set of characteristics and their frequent use of the product, and their deep and active information processing makes their experience particularly meaningful for product developers in terms of discovering potential product performance and to make product<marker type="page" number="6"/><marker type="block"/> improvements before the product is launched. Advanced users will recognize benefits, shortcomings, and problems faster and more accurately than mainstream consumers. They may thus serve as valuable trial and error testers and solution generators throughout the phases of product development. Interacting with advanced users allows the product developer to get a contact to users who deliver more reliable information to product development. The advanced user idea generation approach is similar to the conventional listening to consumer approach in principle, but differs in that it lets users generate the solutions rather than letting “in-house product developers” do it. The critical cost of this approach is the difficulty of identifying truly advanced users who are willing to participate actively. Another problem reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16" id="61" class="deo:Reference">Olson and Bakke (2001)</xref> that appears internally in the product developer firm is that developers have a tendency to abandon the method because they perceive results of user interaction as being too ambiguous or overly simplistic.</region>

          <h2 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="63" confidence="possible" page="6" column="1">User toolkits for innovation: a strong form of consumer involvement</h2>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="74" page="6" column="1">While information iterations and boundary spanning between product developers and consumers impose significant costs on the two approaches outlined above, these processes can to a certain extent be eliminated in the strongest method for OCI – “user toolkits for innovation”. Recent work by von <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27" id="64" class="deo:Reference">Hippel (2001)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23" id="65" class="deo:Reference">Thomke and von Hippel (2002)</xref>, and von <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6" id="66" class="deo:Reference">Hippel and Katz (2002)</xref> suggest user toolkits for innovation as a solution to the information stickiness problem. The objective of the user toolkit approach is to facilitate consumers in carrying out certain need related tasks (often design work) themselves by equipping them with design tools. The user toolkits method is built around the idea of a new task partitioning of product development that co-locates problem solving tasks with sticky need-related information in the consumer setting. Thus, the intention is obviously not to reduce stickiness itself, but instead to eliminate the need for information transfer and iterations throughout the development process by out-sourcing tasks of product development to consumers. According to the authors, toolkits should divide tasks so that consumers primarily carry out tasks related to the core areas of development that involve their sticky information. Typically consumers do not know what they want from the beginning of the design process and can therefore not articulate their needs to a given manufacturer. Letting them carry out essential design-by-trial-and-error processes - from applying a solution in<marker type="page" number="7"/><marker type="block"/> the use setting till a satisfactory solution is achieved – avoids the costly iteration and speeds up the process by which consumers can alter product concepts as their wants change.<marker type="block"/> As illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" id="71" class="deo:Reference">Table 1</xref>, both the first (listening to consumer) and the second (interaction with advanced users) approach have separate locations of need-related information and the problem-solving locus of product development. In contrast, the toolkit method co-locates essential information with problem-solving activities in the user domain. This leaves the consumer with the opportunity to carry out design work. In the remaining part of this paper, I shall focus on the role of support and supervision needed for each of the three different approaches. The application of a toolkit in a real business context can be illustrated by the example of Westwood Studios – a leading developer of computer games. Westwood Studios is an example of a firm that moved between OCI-categories; from primarily using conventional market research methods in the early 1990s, the firm began to employ interaction with advanced users approach in mid-1990s. At the beginning of the year 2001 the firm introduced its first toolkit to consumers. The toolkit now offered by Westwood Studios is a software editor that allows computer game aficionados to build new graphic environments (e.g. maps and missions) to their game. Nowadays Westwood Studio’s consumers do detailed design work and engage in week-long innovation endeavors that, according to managers at Westwood, yield valuable content to the product. How toolkits make sense in economic terms is also illustrated by this case. Consumer-generated content has in several instances been of a quality sufficiently high to substitute Westwood Studio’s own product development efforts, and provided a low cost but high quality input to the<marker type="page" number="8"/><marker type="block"/> firm’s products. With their toolkits, consumers carry out labor-intensive design work that traditionally has been done in-house by computer game manufactures. For example, when a manufacturer develops a new computer game map in-house by employing a professional art designer, (who on average earns $59 612 USD per year 2 and typically spends ten days to create a high quality map) Westwood Studio’s labor costs of creating a single quality map can be calculated to roughly $2 980 USD. Consumers frequently make maps that reach levels of “professional” quality. Westwood Studios have chosen to continuously have 8-12 consumer-made maps available for download at their website side by side with an equal number of professionally made maps. In the online consumer environments connected with Westwood’s products several hundred map-extensions circulate among consumers. According to managers at Westwood the outcomes of toolkit use (maps) and the circulation of these outcomes extend the product lifetime – computer games can simply stay popular longer when additional product content that adds to the consumption experience is turned out on a continuing basis 3 .</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="76" page="8" column="1">Anyone who has struggled with a balky computer, French cuisine, or databases for airline schedules understands the importance of being compensated in some way for one’s lack of abilities – at least in the initial stages of the use process. Further, the balkier or the more complex the computer, the cookery adventure, or the travel database, the more compensation will typically be required for one’s activity to reach a satisfactory result. Support and supervision are the labels given to various forms of assistance that firms offer their customers to help them optimize their skills so that they gain maximum value from their products or services. There are various ways for firms to support their consumers. Characteristic types of support include installing, documentation, maintenance, and repair services, user training, and equipment upgrade (Goffin, 2001). The term “service” normally refers to maintenance and repair issues, whereas the broader term</region>

An example of a typical mass-customization tool is Nike’s iD allowing customization of sports shoes. Here consumers face a palette of limited choices (colors, logos etc.) that restrict them to combine any lace color with any heel color, thus only permitting the consumer to construct a limited number of designs. Toolkits of the nature described in this paper allow consumers a solution space in which designs are not only produced in a combinatorial act, but rather in a creative work process similar to art design. In Appendix A Westwood’s toolkit is briefly illustrated.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="83" page="9" column="1">support and supervision also covers issues such as user training. A respectable level of support and supervision, such as free hotline help and advice play a key role in achieving customer satisfaction it is argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15" id="80" class="deo:Reference">Lele and Sheth (1988)</xref>. Furthermore, support and supervision can be a major source of rents that provides firms with a competitive advantage (Pittiglio and Hoole, 1987). Benham, Delaney, and Luzi, (1993) emphasize that in addition to good design tools and standards, which may foster good programming practices the role of end-user support was crucial to the outcome of end-user computing. This latter point is somewhat substantiated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9" id="81" class="deo:Reference">Guimaraes (1997)</xref> who finds that support and training is crucial to successful end-user computing 4 , and by Bostrom et. al. (1990) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3" id="82" class="deo:Reference">Compeau (2002)</xref> who stress more qualitative aspects of end-user software training for achieving successful outcomes in that field. Support and supervision may thus seem to be relevant considerations at least in situations where consumers face complex tasks, and it might seem reasonable to expect that transferring problem-solving tasks to consumers will have some consequences for consumer support.

The data were collected over a period of two weeks in April 2002. A list of PC computer games released in the year 2001 was obtained at the game site Gamespy.com (covering 95% of all commercially released 4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9" id="87" class="deo:Reference">Guimaraes (1997)</xref> advocate for the establishment of “Information centers”.</region>

Of those, data were not available on 16 occasions, leaving us with 78 observations. Firm support and supervision to consumers is a key function of the online communities. The support and supervision available to consumers in this industry is almost exclusively channeled though the online communities. When firm personnel communicate with consumers in these communities, they almost always do so to support and supervise consumers. The computer games industry is chosen for the reason that it allows us to observe factual support rates and to establish and confine the limits of discrete groups of the OCI variable in a relatively straightforward manner. Via the online communities, most firms in the industry habitually have a segment of their consumers involved in some way that falls into the OCI spectrum described, ranging from “weak to strong involvement of consumers”.

          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="99" page="10" column="1">Support and supervision (dependent variable): Connected to each observation, a value for the actual rate of support and supervision that firms offer to each of the products in their online communities could be determined. The degree of support and supervision that is allocated to each product’s consumers was determined by calculating the rate of the firm’s employees share of messaging on the firm’s online community (moderators, support staff etc.) divided by the total rate of messages generated by both consumers and firm personnel in that community. Thus, firm provided consumer support = firm messages / total amount of messages. OCI, degree of opportunities for consumer involvement. The 78 observed entities were broken down into three categories according to their OCI characteristics. The sample comprises data that describe the character of the product in terms of the opportunities that it offers consumers for involvement. The degree to which the product is open to OCI was rated on a three- point scale with 1 being low OCI and 3 being a high degree of OCI. The concrete measures are as follows: <marker type="page" number="11"/><marker type="block"/> 1 = (weak involvement): A product for which the opportunity for consumer involvement is non-existent or weak. For example, a product for which no software editors, and no debugging/testing is open to the consumer. Consumers may often have the chance to communicate their opinion openly in the online community. 2 = (moderate involvement): Consumers are not allowed to rework or extend features, but are offered the opportunity to systematically report bugs and test beta versions. 3 = (strong involvement): Products that offer toolkits (software editors), allowing consumers to rework or extend certain features of the original product 5 .<marker type="block"/>  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2" id="98" class="deo:Reference">Table 2</xref> displays descriptive statistics for the variable OCI. It can be observed from the table that approximately 42 percent of the sample offer no or low OCI to their consumers, 23 percent invite consumers to become moderately involved, while 35 percent offer a high opportunity for consumer involvement by making toolkits available.</region>

The outcome of the analysis shows that consumers using toolkits will tend to be more supported than less involved consumers. This suggests that toolkits may not necessarily be successfully employed without considerations of how to compensate consumers with support. It means that the toolkit approach does not only reduce cost related to acquiring sticky information for product development ventures; in addition it entails costs of supervising consumers. I chose to interpret the support provided as a sign of consumers being involved “over their head”. Consumer support and supervision rates correlate with stronger OCI is a sign of consumers not being appropriately equipped with the capabilities to take on specific problem-solving tasks that relate to the use of the new tools. Consumers may wish to exploit more of the possibilities available in the toolkit, but do not know how to do so. Consumers may not understand the limits to their own capacity, or may simply not be able to handle the tool.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="116" confidence="possible" page="13" column="1">Solution space The solution space is set by the toolkit provider who determines the set of functions over which consumers have control. In other words, the size of solution space determines the amount of freedom that consumers have for their creations. When solution space is large, toolkit use will tend to be more complex, because there will be more functions to master, and there will be more decisions to make for a given consumer on which functions to employ in a given situation. A solution to a given problem will tend to be hidden among a great number of alternatives when solution space is large.</region>

The existing consumer design capability is thus the embedded level of consumer excellence determining what consumers are able to do and refers to relevant experience, knowledge, and hence the problem-solving capacity that a given consumer possesses for dealing with specific tools. Consumer design capability enhances the consumer’s chances of locating an appropriate solution to a given problem or choosing the right function, or combination of functions, in the “toolkit menu”.</region>

          <h2 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="120" confidence="possible" page="14" column="1">Support</h2>
          <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="124" page="14" column="1">Support is – as noted previously – seen as the way the toolkit provider can choose to compensate consumers when they are not capable of dealing with the tools that have been provided to them or with the projects that they have become involved in through toolkit use. Support should also be interpreted as an important element of user training through which consumer design capabilities are upgraded. <marker type="block"/> The three dimensions of the toolkit approach are interrelated. Imagine for example that a firm chooses to increases the solution space left open to consumers. This will give the consumer more freedom to do his designs. However, increasing the solution space (making the toolkit more complex) will increase the requirements placed on consumer design capabilities and/or on their substitute, namely, support and supervision. The successful employment of toolkits thus requires the consideration of key tradeoffs. How complex can the tasks in which consumers are involved into be? What are the benefits of letting consumer carry out tasks? How much is one’s firm willing to invest in support functions? Should toolkits be designed to fit the capability level of the lowest common denominator or should they aim at the advanced user segment? Since toolkits are specific to a given product, these tradeoffs will be so too. How tradeoffs are made clearly affects the quality and quantity of possible outcomes and the need for support and supervision. If toolkits place great demands on consumer design capabilities (which at least at the outset, must be expected to be scarce), outcomes will be fewer, but probably of a higher quality. If, on the other hand, toolkits are intended to capture less capable individuals the outcomes will not be as sophisticated, but the quantity of outcomes may be great because fewer potential toolkits users will be excluded from using the toolkit. The relationship between the<marker type="page" number="15"/><marker type="block"/> complexity of the toolkit and the consumer design capabilities is important to the support question. One may imagine a toolkit provider who wants to involve his consumers in highly complex tasks immediately after the toolkit is released. He then creates a highly advanced toolkit but must be aware that support is needed (at least at the beginning) to initiate consumers. The alternative would be to launch a toolkit with a limited solution space to save on support costs and then expect consumers to work out solutions on their own. This, however, will possibly give rise to a slower progress of consumer abilities, which means that the toolkit provider must wait longer for sophisticated outcomes to appear.</region>

        <h1 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="125" confidence="possible" page="15" column="1">7. Consumer learning – a means of reducing support costs</h1>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="132" page="15" column="1">One attractive solution is available to toolkit providers for achieving an economical production of user-generated custom designs. We know from earlier studies that “learning by doing” and “learning by using” play important roles for the quality of user-driven innovations (see von <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25" id="126" class="deo:Reference">Hippel 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20" id="127" class="deo:Reference">Rosenberg, 1982</xref>). Such consumer learning processes are important because over time they may reduce the need for support and supervision, allow consumers to take on more tricky tasks, and improve outcomes designed by toolkits. In fact, an amount of the observed support given to toolkit users by toolkit providers may mainly relate to “getting consumers over the capability entry barriers to toolkit use”. In other words, consumers need to learn (or be taught) a few tricks before they can be left alone to do design work. Recent progress within some practical fields now allows toolkit providers to exploit interactive learning among consumers. Instead of relying on progress in toolkit use via the learning by doing process of a solitary toolkit user, we here point to a new form of organizing consumer learning that may have a significant (positive) impact on the future of the toolkit approach to product development. Most firms in the computer games industry have - as we mentioned previously established online communities that favor interactive consumer-to-consumer learning. This means that a community of consumers, all sharing the same specific toolkit can now communicate on a global scale at a low cost. At least two studies of ICT-based help-lines (Constant, et. al., 1996; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14" id="128" class="deo:Reference">Lakhani and von Hippel, 2003</xref>) show willingness even among strangers to provide useful technical assistance to each other. Thus, within this context<marker type="page" number="16"/><marker type="block"/> there is the possibility that less capable consumers may learn tricks from fellow consumers who already have solutions to problems and thus upgrade their capabilities. This may in turn pave the way for more sophisticated outcomes and will possibly diminish the amount of support required from firm personnel, because this function is now partly carried out on a consumer-to-consumer basis. As the consumers of a given product share a specific tool in common with their numerous fellow community goers, there are favorable conditions for interactive trial and error problem solving. Further, according to a classical argument about social diffusion (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2" id="131" class="deo:Reference">Coleman, 1964</xref>), “best practice toolkit use” will spread faster when individuals are “integrated” than when they are isolated. It follows that a high degree of connectivity among participant should be seen as a constructive feature for lowering firms’ support costs. Thus, when consumer–to-consumer learning synergies can be arranged there is a scope for high quality outcomes of toolkit use. The following section presents a case study of Westwood Studios’ online community. The study aims at determining the sources of support in the context where a toolkit provider offers an online community that enables interaction between the firm and consumers, and among consumers.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="138" page="16" column="1">To measure the rates of support and supervision available from a) the toolkit providers and b) through the consumer-to-consumer interactions respectively, we have explored the function of the Final Alert Online Community (henceforth FAOC). The community gets its name from Westwood’s toolkit - the software editor Final Alert – and is Westwood Studio’s site for discussion and co-operation concerning map-making with the editor. This particular site is one of four subdivisions constituting the overall community connected to the popular series of computer games called “Command and Conquer - Red Alert and Yuri’s Revenge”. Westwood Studios inaugurated FAOC on June 8, 2001, simultaneously with the release of their very first editor. Through the community, Westwood could now support novice mapmakers, monitor ongoing mapmaker-to-mapmaker interactions, and make sure that consumers would have a place to discuss toolkit related issues. We acquired the web log of FAOC, which allowed us to study the entire set of firm-consumer and <marker type="page" number="17"/><marker type="block"/> consumer-to-consumer interactions throughout the period starting June 8 until November 23, 2001. In that interval the community accumulated 801 members who generated 2,530 discussion topics, which in total produced 18,875 messages. This particular case is interesting, and has been chosen, because it illustrates a situation in which firm support to consumers is low, but where the production of quality consumer creations (new maps) created with the Final Alert editor is still high 6 . In terms of support rates allocated Westwood Studios falls off the regression line of our previous analysis (see Sections 4 and 5). As one of Westwood’s online community managers explains: “the community FAOC has been very self-contained”. It is exactly this counter- intuitive aspect that makes the particular case interesting for our purposes: it shows us that the toolkit approach can be effective without a high degree of firm support. The aim of the rest of this paper is to explain how. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" id="137" class="deo:Reference">Figure 1</xref> below shows the distribution of community goers in FAOC according to their activity.

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="150" page="18" column="1">Westwood employs three so-called online community managers who carry out various duties attached to the Command and Conquer game universe. Two of them divide their work hours between several different work functions related to a number of Westwood’s (Command and Conquer Series) online communities but are not specialized in toolkit issues, while one “official toolkit supporter” (henceforth OTS) devotes on average 10 hours a week explicitly to supporting toolkit users in FAOC. Thus, apart from Westwood’s investment in toolkit development 7 , an auxiliary investment to support toolkit users has been made. Within the period studied, the OTS at FAOC contributed with 297 support messages that entered into 256 discussion topics, meaning that he had supplied comments to more than 1 out of 10 discussion topics (10,1%). This made him the top 12 poster in the community. A typical discussion in a FAOC interaction in which the OTS participates is outlined below. <marker type="page" number="19"/><marker type="block"/> Above, a community goer (Subzero46) poses a question then, a bit of noise is created from a fellow community goer (Shadow454) and finally, the OTS steps in with what we shall label a “solution-oriented answer”. In the remaining part of this paper we shall employ solution-oriented answers as our proxy for support. Solution-oriented answers are those answers that are directly valid for solving a given problem. Solution-oriented answering is the incarnation of the OTS’s function. However, as the remainder of the paper illustrates, such solution-oriented answers may stem from sources other than an OTS.</region>

Westwood Studio’s overall community is placed as no.6 (counted from below) out of 27 with a firm share of messaging on only a total of 3,8%. The average rate of firm messaging on firms’ own is 12.9%. The top scorer-firm in the sample has a share of support of 39,5% (see Appendix B). 7 A private “lead user” - a 16-year-old game aficionado from Germany named ”Mathias” - carried out the initial development of the Final Alert editor. Mathias later finished the editor in co-operation with Westwood’s engineers. Westwood encountered Mathias in their online community. They subsequently contracted him to work with Westwood to improve the device. When the editor and the FAOC were launched Mathias was employed as Westwood’s official toolkit supporter.</region>

To do so we have generated a random-sample containing 493 messages from the entire number of messages contained in Westwood/FAOC’s web log. In order to employ solution-oriented answers as a proxy for support we obviously need to be able to determine 1) the rates of answers versus questions, and 2) the rates of solution-oriented contributions versus other types of contributions. Furthermore, we want to investigate how question-answers ratios and solution-oriented answer ratios are distributed over the population of community goers, in order to identify to whom - if anyone - support roles can be ascribed.</region>

At the FAOC a typical information seeker posts a question because he does not know how to deal with a certain aspect of the toolkit, and the respondent is a fellow community goer who tries to assist him in solving the problem. Each topic posted in the community usually receives several answers (of which several are often inappropriate). We found in the sample that 306 of the messages (62%) were answers, whereas the rest were questions, statements, or other types of contributions.</region>

In one example did the respondents disagree; thus, they can be said to share a common view on the valuation of messages for map-making purposes. After assuring this, respondents were asked to evaluate the 306 answers previously isolated on the basis of the criteria already established. In total, we found 99 solution-oriented answers in our sample of 493 messages that were to be regarded as solution oriented answers – that is to say, support. It means that approximately 20% of the total number of messages on the FAOC can be classified as support. Of the total number of answers (306) provided by consumers, roughly 32% were solution-oriented answers that potentially substitutes the firm’s own support efforts. This signifies that a given information seeker in FAOC will on average find that approximately 1/3 of the answer given to his questions will be of use to him as support.</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="179" page="22" column="1">1. The study of Westwood Studio’s online community FAOC indicates that approximately 1/3 of the answers provided by consumers to consumers were valid as support that potentially compensates the OTS employed by the firm. 2. 20% of the sample’s messages were solution-oriented answers. Extrapolating this result to the entire amount of messages (18,875), we find that a total of 3964 messages would count as consumer–to-consumer support. This suggests that the overall consumer-to- consumer interaction in FAOC accounted for more than 13 times the OTS-support <marker type="page" number="23"/><marker type="block"/> provided by Westwood Studios, or more than 3 standard full-time employees (working 45 hours a week) 9 . 3. On the basis of the study we can also specify that the support ratio of the most active community goers substantially exceeds the support ratio arising from the least active community goers. We can observe that that least active community goers tend to ask questions while the highly active segment comprise those who answer the greatest number of questions and give the most qualified feedback. In connection with this point, it is important to note that the consumer support provided is crucially dependent on an extremely tiny fraction of dedicated community goers. Jointly, 6 individuals (in Quartile 4) account for a share of support that is roughly 6 times the OTS-support, and we may thus infer that each of these individuals, in terms of providing support, can be compared with the OTS employed by Westwood Studios. Thus, the main reason why FAOC “has been very self-contained”, as explained by a Westwood online community manager, must be ascribed to the support offered by certain core community goers from this community.</region>

        <h1 class="DoCO:SectionTitle" id="180" confidence="possible" page="23" column="1">9. Conclusion</h1>
        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="184" page="23" column="1">We started by sketching out two well-known market research methods for product development: the conventional method of “listening to consumers” and the “interaction- with-advanced-users approach”. Both methods may suffer from high information acquisition costs. Currently, an alternative approach is emerging: – “user toolkits for innovation”, which offers a high degree of opportunities for consumer involvement (OCI) in the product development process. As not much is yet known about its implications, we argued that there is a need for studies in this field. It was hypothesized that like the two former methods, the user toolkit for innovation would also generate some information related costs. Our intuition was that transferring design work to consumers as the toolkit method prescribes would require more support by firms than the other approaches. The intuition was sustained: the analysis shows that firms that offer higher levels of opportunities for consumer involvement allocate more support <marker type="page" number="24"/><marker type="block"/> to their consumers. This means that some of the costs saved on the acquisition of need- related information achieved via the toolkit approach are likely to reappear as consumer support costs. The source of the latter costs is the insufficiency of consumers to handle a given toolkit. It was argued that support is only one of several important interrelated dimensions that determine the effectiveness of user toolkits for innovation. Additional dimensions are: 1) consumers’ design capabilities; 2) the size of solution space left open to consumers. Support is a sign of lacking consumer design capabilities. When the solution space is enlarged, the need for either more support or enhanced consumer design capabilities appears. This means that when a manufacturer wants his consumer to produce better outcomes with the toolkit, a need for support may arise (which prevails at least until consumers acquire the necessary design capabilities). The situation will be affected by consumer learning processes; establishing interaction in communities and consumer-to-consumer help functions is here seen as a possible way for firms to unburden themselves in terms of support and to create conditions for better toolkit use. We investigated to what extent consumer-to-consumer interaction in an online community could compensate for firm support efforts, and found in our case that consumers to a great extent are capable of supporting each other, thus lowering the cost for firms of supporting their toolkit using consumers. However, one should note that the case also showed that consumer-to-consumer support depends on a small segment of dedicated and extremely active consumers. The small core of community goers willingly supports inexperienced novices who only pass by to ask a few questions. In sum, communities that facilitate consumer-to-consumer interaction as illustrated in this example seem to be good news for the toolkit approach, in that communities allow firms to out-source certain tasks to consumers. One may choose to interpret the consumer- to-consumer dynamics as a means for firms to reduce support costs, or simply regard it as “surplus support” that serves as training through which consumers learn how to handle the toolkit better – a process through which the outcomes that can be achieved with the toolkits is enhanced. Seen in relation to a firm strategy in which the aim of using toolkits is to enlarge the amount of quality content available to consumers, the findings described in this case study may be of major importance. Whether the organizational innovation of toolkit user communities discussed throughout this paper will also prove constructive in</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="193" confidence="possible" page="27" column="1">Appendix B A look at the sample of 27 toolkit providing computer games firms (firms providing OCI=3) shows that – despite a large within segment variation – firms’ share of messaging (support) in the online communities generally only constitutes a minor fraction of the total messaging within this context. The average message share by firm’s personnel is 12,9%, meaning that consumers generally generate the major share of messaging in these contexts. Distribution of support provided by firms that offer toolkits 50% 39,5 40% 37,7 30% 24,8 22,2 20% 17,0 17,2 17,5 17,7 18,3 18,4 19,5 13,9 9,8 10,0 10,2 11,0 10% 6,0 6,3 6,6 6,9 8,0 2,1 2,5 3,8 0,0 0,0 0,0 0% 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 Firm' share of total postings</region>

        <region class="DoCO:TextChunk" id="196" confidence="possible" page="28" column="1">Appendix C Examples of message in each category (messages from FAOC sample) “Very useful” 1) Common question this,and yes it can be done easily with triggers,there are several really good threads on this subject if you use the search option.However quick method. Place a waypoint close to a building say an army tent for example.Next make a trigger civilian,standard but not disabled.Event 0: building destroyed by any team.Action 0:create crate at,give the waypoint as the parametre and as for the crate theres a long list in one of the foremention threads,make the crate 0,which is money.Next return to your map and select the tent,in the pop-up box where it says tag,select and input your trigger,there your done.Now when the tent is destroyed the crate will appear,hope this helps. 2) I don't have the editor open in front of me so I don't have the event/action numbers available... so bear with me.Use the "celltag entered" action and attach the trigger to the structure. You don't need to make a celltag since the structure will act as a celltag, and if it's destroyed then the "celltag" won't exist anymore. For house number, use "-1" and it will work for anybody.Crate values:0=Money1=Unit2=HealBase3=Cloak4=Explosion5=Napalm6=Money7=Darkn ess8=Reveal9=Armor10=Speed11=Firepower12=ICBM13=??? (TS?14=Veteran15=??? (TS?16=Gas17=Tiberium18=??? (TS?For examples, see the WW mappack map "Arena.mmx" (look at and my map "Gem Pit".As for your other question, the INI editing you would do is:CrateBeneath=yesCrateBeneathIsMoney=yes (if you want it to be moneyThis can be seen in Gem Pit as well."CarriesCrate" is a key used for Vehicles I believe. “Perhaps useful” 1) One of the maps in the project I'm working on has 122 waypoints in it and no problems encountered..don't know what the problem could be 2) Tiberian Sun did the same thing. No units can attack while in transit in a tunnel. It gets really dumb when opposing units enter the tunnel from either end, since they go past each other without fighting. Also once a unit is moving through a tunnel it must complete the move, it can't stop, or abort and turn back. Personally I was glad when the tunnels didn't appear in RA2. “Not useful” 1) Hey guys, thanks for all the replies and not flaming me... After spending so much time on the board I was getting ready for replies of STOOPID NEWB' I feel warm and fuzzy now Well, I've gotten that problem out of the way... now I'm working on lighting... I tried to make a late evening map... but I'm rambling.Anyway, thanks for the help 2) RV, must've been from the master, huh?Lol, I give you all the props in the world, dude! 3) AHH. Good job on the map.</region>
