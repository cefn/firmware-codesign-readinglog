      "This article...describes three principles of system design which we
      believe must be followed to produce a useful and easy to use computer
      system. These principles are: early and continual focus on users;
      empirical measurement of usage; and iterative design whereby the system
      (simulated, prototype, and real) is modified, tested, modified again,
      tested again, and the cycle is repeated again and again.
    </p>
        <p>
      ""More comprehensive testing can be done by constructing a simulated
      system. For example Gould, Conti, and Hovanyecz [21] did extensive
      testing of a “listening typewriter,” a device that would use speech
      recognition to give real-time visual feedback during dictation, by using
      a human typist in the computer feedback loop."
    </p>
        <p>
      "It is our personal experience and observation that building simulated or
      informal prototypes, rather than delaying or lengthening system
      development, actually<br/>
      helps get a new project off the ground, gives it something tangible for
      others to see, and stimulates thought and progress."
    </p>
        <p>
      "While some aspects of new technology may be difficult to simulate we
      have never encountered a design problem in which at least some important
      aspects could not be uslefully simulated.
