      "the authors propose that this drive towards participation (and more
      recently, taking this further – codesign) means the design briefing
      process has also evolved, from a specification document to a dynamic,
      non-linear, process, which engages the clients, designer, users and other
      stakeholders in this age of participation."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Designers are now framing the problem and developing solutions with
      clients and users – and actively involving users throughout<br/>
      the entire process. This dynamic relationship becomes a trade-off between
      the designer’s Expertise in design, the client’s Experience of their
      business and indeed the user’s Engagement in the whole process, which the
      authors propose as the 3E approach. The whole process makes for a
      “mutually-engaging” briefing experience, which enhances participation and
      provides a collective learning opportunity."
    </p>
        <p>
      "We propose that it is the design brief – or rather the design briefing
      process that has evolved, and adapted and embraced participation,
      re-defining briefing as a holistic ‘democratic’ activity."

      "This view has since evolved to the view of briefing as a process
      (Phillips, 2004). This process however, is linear, prescriptive and tends
      not to embrace complexity; focusing This view has since evolved to the
