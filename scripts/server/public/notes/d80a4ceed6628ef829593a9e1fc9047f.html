      "t is not easy being a bricoleur. A bricoleur works within and between
      competing and overlapping perspectives and paradigms (and is familiar
      with these). To do so they must read widely, to become knowledgeable
      about a variety of interpretive paradigms that can be brought to a
      problem, drawing on Feminism, Marxism, Cultural studies, Constructivism,
      and including processes of phenomenography, grounded theory, visual
      analysis, narratology, ethnography, case and field study, structuralism
      and poststructuralism, triangulation, survey etc."
