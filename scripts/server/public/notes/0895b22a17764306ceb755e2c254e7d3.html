      "This paper describes an investigation into the adoption and use of UML
      in the software development community. A web-based survey was conducted
      eliciting responses from users of UML worldwide. Results indicate a wide
      diversity of opinion regarding UML, reflecting the relative immaturity of
      the technology as well as the controversy over its effectiveness."

      "Promoted as a unified approach which incorporates the ‘best practices’
      of previous notational methods, UML promises to relieve some of the
      problems associated with object-oriented software development. However,
      there is a severe lack of empirical evidence supporting the claim that
      UML leads to greater performance and a number of problems continue to be
      reported concerning its usage (e.g. complexity, inconsistency, difficulty
      to learn, incompleteness)."
