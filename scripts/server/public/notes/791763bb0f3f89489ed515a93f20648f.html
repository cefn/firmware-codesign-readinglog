    <p>
      &#160;Looks into how a computing device could sense users' frustration.
      Could be relevant for examples where design needs reviewing.

      "What is Frustration? When early psychological experimenters began to do
      behaviorist studies, they began to more rigorously define the notion of
      frustration. Psychologists came to see frustration as the negative
      feelings that arise when attempts to achieve a goal are thwarted."

      "One compelling application for this technology is the creation of
      universal and distributed usability services. If we distribute interfaces
      that allow people to easily send feedback about aspects of their systems,
      then we can begin to continuously collect usability information from
      them. We get a broader and more complete picture of what our users find
      frustrating, and one drawn from real world use settings instead of an
      artificial laboratory."

      "researchers have been building disembodied intelligences that do not
      take into account the subtleness or whimsy of human behavior."
