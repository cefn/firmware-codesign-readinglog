      Accuses established design processes of using 'computerese' as a
      specification language and militates for something better. Directly
      linked to boundary objects and comprehensibility for non-programmers.

    <p>
      "The goal of the JAD<br />
      approach is to produce higher quality software in an<br />
      accelerated time by having both users and analysts<br />
      accept responsibility and become heavily involved in<br />
      the system development. The JAD approach is con-<br />
      ducted through a series of meetings called JAD sessions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We identify three major types of activities in this process:<br />
      One activity is the analysis, which is a discovery and<br />
      model building activity. Another activity is prototype<br />
      execution, which is a verification and refinement activity.<br />
      The third activity is specification development, which<br />
      also includes verification and refinement, and additionally encompasses
      documentation and ‘contractual’ agreement. One of the major contributions
      of our<br />
      approach is the integration of JAD with the development<br />
      of formal specifications."
