      Notes
    </h2>
        <p>
      Stolterman seems to be at the intersection of Interaction Design and
      Participatory design, co-publishing for example with Fallman.

      "For several decades, the field of design methodology has addressed
      design processes, epistemological considerations, and work practices in
      the design disciplines [2, 10, 11, 13]. There are good reasons for
      considering the development of software as a design discipline [7, 14]."
    </p>
        <p>
      "our purpose here is to argue that software design could benefit from
      other, more traditional design disciplines"
