    <p>
      Fischer is a key writer about meta-design; "designing for design", which
      intersects strongly with the problem of creating assets and learning
      trajectories for co-design workshops.

    <h2>
      Quotations
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Complex design problems require more knowledge than any one single
      person can possess, and the knowledge relevant to a problem is<br />
      often distributed and controversial."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather than being a limiting factor, 'symmetry of ignorance' can provide
      the foundation for social creativity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Social creativity can be supported by new media that allow owners of
      problems to contribute to framing and solving these problems."
    </p>
    <p>
      "the activity or the product is not necessarily novel or original to a
      community of practice or society as a whole - but psychological, meaning
      it is personally novel and meaningful to the stakeholders who produced
      it"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This paper explores three interrelated concepts: symmetry of ignorance,
      social creativity, and meta-design"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The predominant activity in designing complex systems is that
      participants teach and instruct each other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because complex problems require more knowledge than any single person
      possesses, communication and collaboration among<br />
      all the involved stakeholders are necessary; for example, domain experts
      understand the practice, and system designers know the technology."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In order to bring important perspectives to the process of design, all
      stakeholders in the process should be designers and co-developers, not
      just consumers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "End-users, as owners of problems, bring special perspectives to
      collaborative design activities that are of special importance for the
      framing of problems."
    </p>
    <p>
      "approaches ...that view learning as collaborative knowledge construction
      [are] in sharp contrast to the teaching cultures of our schools, by which
      teaching is often fitted into a mold in which a single, presumably
      omniscient teacher explicitly tells or shows presumably unknowing
      learners something they presumably know nothing about"
    </p>
    <p>
      "a human coach, a design critic, or a teacher can help the learner to
      identify the breakdown situation and to provide task-relevant information
      for reflection" £
    </p>
    <p>
      "In our own work, we have explored the possibility of using computational
      critics to provide some of this support when humans are not present.
      Critics make argumentation serve design; this is, they support learners
      in their own activities." £
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mutual competency supported by objects-to-think-with (externalization of
      ideas, concepts, and goals), leads to settings and opportunities for
      learning by all participants." £ especially the concept of
      objects-to-think-with
    </p>
    <p>
      "Empowering individuals requires conceptual frameworks and computational
      environments that will give domain designers more independence from
      computer specialists. Past L 3 D research has developed conceptual
      frameworks to empower individuals by developing domain-oriented design
      environments (DODEs) [20], which make the computer invisible, and
      bringing tasks to the forefront in a variety of different domains. By
      being domain-oriented, they support (1) breakdowns, (2) critics, and (3)
      learning on demand." <span style="text-decoration: underline;">£ esp
      'domain-oriented', and 'independence from computer specialists'</span>
