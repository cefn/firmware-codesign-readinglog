        <p>
      Discusses how to avoid the overhead of 'coded prototypes' and draws on
      graphic designers strategies to communicate ideas early for discussion.
      Produce interactive simulations of interfaces. Observation about people
      being 'stuck' on existing behaviours which they've invested in is surely
      going to be worst of all in our case - engineers having even 'deployed'
      existing firmware. Managing this conflict (politics) is important.

      "I've also discovered the benefits of not showing a questionable
      interface soludon at all. Leaving out details can encourage the team to
      consider alternative designs."

      "As a designer creating the prototypes, working rough in early stages is
      beneficial. It is important to remain flexible toward change and avoid
      commitment to ~a' design. This technique avoid spending too much time
      tweaking pixels and adding unnecessary details. Often, a designer may
      feel attached to an idea ff too much time and effort is spent creating
      it. The idea becomes precious and the designer will often be less
      responsive to critical feedback and less willing to change it."
