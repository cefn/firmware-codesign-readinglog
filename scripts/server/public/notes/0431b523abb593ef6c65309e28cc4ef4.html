      "we conducted think-aloud experiments with expert architects...where they
      were not allowed sketch and where they were<br/>
      allowed to sketch.The results show that there is<br/>
      no significant difference between sketching and not sketching based
      on<br/>
      three assessments: design outcome, cognitive activity and idea links.
      This<br/>
      case study shows that sketching is not an essential activity for
      expert<br/>
      architects in the early phases of conceptual designing."
