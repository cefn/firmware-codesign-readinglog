      "Whether you’re designing a Web site or a medical device—or something
      somewhere in between—your audience is comprised of the people who will
      benefit from that design. And the totality of your audience’s experience
      is profoundly impacted by what you know—or don’t know—about them. How do
      they think? How do they decide? What motivates them to click or purchase
      or whatever it is you want them to do? You’ll learn those things in this
      book"
