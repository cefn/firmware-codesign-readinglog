      "PD research began in the mid 1970’s in reaction to the ways in which
      computer-based systems were introduced in the workplace"
    </p>
        <p>
      "The pioneering work of Nygaard and his associates in the NJMF project
      (Nygaard, 1979) was the foundation upon which later PD<br/>
      projects, the Swedish DEMOS project (Ehn and Sanberg, 1979) and the
      Danish DUE project (Kyng and Mathiassen, 1982), were launched. The
      strategy included a research agenda in which researchers and local trade
      unions explored the potential and actual consequences of introducing
      specific computer-based systems into the workplace (Arena A) and
      developed goals and strategies for workers and their unions to pursue in
      relation to management’s technological initiatives (Arena B)."
    </p>
        <p>
      "management’s goals and strategies often were built into the new systems
      and were reinforced by organizational distributions of power, making it
      difficult to alter the technology to fit workers’ needs and interests.
      Researchers and workers were interested in determining if it would be
      possible to design, develop, and implement technologies which took as
      their starting point the needs and interests of workers."
    </p>
        <p>
      "three basic requirements for participation outlined by Kensing (1983):
      (1) access to relevant information, (2) the possibility for taking an
      independent position on the problems, and (3) participation in decision
      making. They add two additional requirements: (4) the availability of
      appropriate participatory development methods and (5) room for
      alternative technical and/or organizational arrangements."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Of central importance is the development of meaningful and productive
      relations between those charged with technology design and those who must
      live with its consequences."
    </p>
        <p>
      "At one end of the spectrum, worker participation is limited to providing
      designers with access to workers’ skills and experiences. The
      workers<br/>
      have little or no control over the design process or its
      outcome...Workers are asked to participate in those aspects of the
      project where their input is viewed as valuable (e.g. description of
      current work practices and testing/evaluation of technology) but left out
      of most technology-related decisions....At the other end of the
      spectrum...workers participate in negotiations over how projects are
      organized and what outcomes are desired. They take an active part in (1)
      the analysis of needs and possibilities, (2) the evaluation and selection
      of technology components, (3) the design and prototyping of new
      technologies, and (4) the organizational implementation."
