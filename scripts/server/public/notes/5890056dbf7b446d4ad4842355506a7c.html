      &#160;They try to introduce goal-oriented processes, with Goal Cards, to
      steer investments, which are annotated with "Business Goals" [WHY],
      "Usage Goals", [HOW] "Steps" [WHAT]. Their statements below, concerning
      their Goal Cards positions them squarely as boundary objects within a
      software design process.

      "In the optimal development process, every design decision would increase
      the probability that the product will generate the expected business
      value.<br />
      However, due to the fact that the focus of systems development is rarely
      the product’s quality-in-use [Ehn 1997], there is no effective way of
      telling whether the design decision will actually generate the business
      value or not. What often seems to be forgotten is that the generated
      business value corresponds to the level of usage (number of users who
      actually use the product) and the product’s quality-in-use<br />
      (effectiveness, efficiency and user satisfaction when the product is
      used). In other words, business value<br />
      is generated through product usage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of the biggest problems in IT development is that design decisions
      are rarely made explicit during the development of the system. This means
      that there is no description of how the imaginary product will create
      expected values that will lead to the desired business goals, i.e. which
      attributes in the product contributes to the expected values and to what
      extent. Many design decisions are made without having the product's
      quality-in-use in focus...However, there is no effective business and
      usage based technique for discussing potential design decisions, or for
      explaining the rationale behind design decisions...In [the] worst case,
      decisions are made that steers the product's presentation, behaviour and
      content away from those attributes needed to create business
      value."&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;

      "In the second project, an Internet based history teaching tool, the
      project participants had extremely different backgrounds, ranging from
      artists to<br />
      programmers. In this case the primary benefit of the Goal Card was that
      it really helped the project team to form common view of the product
      design despite different perspectives."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Goal Cards differs from the concept of design rationale in the sense
      that it describes expected business and usage effects for any product
      decision, thus creating a chain of reasoning that can be reviewed by all
      stakeholders."
