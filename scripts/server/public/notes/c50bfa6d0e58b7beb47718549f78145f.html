        <p>
      They describe the deployment of an automated system to uncover
      ambiguities and vagueness within technical specification documents.

      "Requirements engineering is a communication process that involves
      understanding and coordinating terminologies from different<br/>
      disciplines."
    </p>
        <p>
      "[Requirements] are discussed and modified over time to arrive as far as
      possible at a...specification that is testable, unambiguous, complete,
      and correct."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Terminology that belongs to one knowledge system is often misunderstood
      by people who work with another knowledge system."
    </p>
        <p>
      "<em>Lexical ambiguity</em> refers to single expressions that may be
      reasonably interpreted in more than one way."
    </p>
        <p>
      "<em>[Syntactic ambiguities</em> occur] when pronouns and relative
      clauses can refer back to two or more other elements of the preceding
      sentence ...[leading] to different interpretations"
    </p>
        <p>
      "<em>Discourse ambiguities</em> are defined as incompatibility between
      several requirements"
    </p>
        <p>
      "vagueness [where it is] difficult to form any interpretation at the
      desired level of specificity. This is in contrast to ambiguity, where
      more than one interpretation is evoked."
    </p>
        <p>
      "correcting faults requires close cooperation between linguists and
      domain experts whose knowledge is required to recognize and remedy
      linguistic faults"
    </p>
