    <p>
      "The design research map is defined and described by two intersecting
      dimensions: One is defined by approach and the other is defined by
      mind-set. Approaches to design research have come from a research-led
      perspective (shown at the bottom of the map) and from a design-led
      perspective (shown at the top of the map)."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Design researchers who have a participatory mind-set value people as
      co-creators in the design process."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Participatory design attempts to involve those who will become the
      “users” throughout the design development process to the extent that this
      is possible. A key characteristic of the participatory design zone is the
      use of physical artifacts as thinking tools throughout the process,
      common among the methods emanating from the research-led Scandinavian
      tradition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The students located themselves primarily on the expert-driven side of
      the map, spanning research-led (the engineers were here) and design-led
      (the designers were here) approaches."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some of the new tools and methods for design research are listed below.
      It is interesting to note that most of them are from the European design
      research community. (See Figure 5.)<br />

      Notes
    </h2>
    <p>
      Includes a fantastic plot for orientation, which positions design
      research projects on two axes - depending on how expert vs. participatory
      the mindset, and how research vs. design the approach. This could really
      help to present the location of my work to supervisors.
