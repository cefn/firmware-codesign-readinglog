      Provides a potential boundary object for firmware co-design - that of
      interaction design <em><strong>patterns</strong></em> perhaps evoked by
      an archetypal example of its use, which participants may already be
      familiar with, or could be exposed to. It also provides a model of the
      way in which design alternatives could be structured and navigated
      according to relationships such as <strong><em>is-a</em></strong> or
      <strong><em>has-a</em></strong> or <strong><em>relates-to</em></strong>.

      "After initial investigations of the applicability of patterns for
      Interaction Design (Borchers 2001), actual patterns collections are now
      publicly available in books (van Duyne, 2002, Graham 2003, Borchers 2001)
      or online (van Welie, 2000, Tidwell 1998). With a total count of more
      than 250 published patterns, the organization and classification of
      patterns is becoming a practical issue. Pattern organization is necessary
      to facilitate the selection of individual patterns but also to find
      patterns that are applicable in a broader context of any given design
      problem."
    </p>
    <p>
      "a set of connected patterns is called a pattern language."
    </p>
    <p>
      "user interfaces are not strictly hierarchical in a geometrical sense.
      There is certainly a 2D display involved but what is shown on it varies
      over time"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Object Oriented Software Design, use a different organization,
      categorizing them in creational, structural and behavioural"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In Interaction Design several alternative organizations have been
      proposed. Mahemoff (1998) distinguishes patterns for tasks, users,
      user-interface elements, and entire systems."
    </p>
    <p>
      "More recently, substantial bodies of patterns have been published, e.g.
      van Duyne et al (2002) which makes the discussion more relevant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The basic assumption in the concept of a pattern language is that
      patterns are related to each other, forming a network of connected
      patterns. These relationships are at the heart of the pattern language
      because they create actual additional value over single patterns... A
      closer look reveals that there are some fundamental relationships
      distinguishable, resembling the types of relationships known from Object
      Oriented Modelling....Aggregation...Specialization...Association" £
      suggest a concrete structure within which design choices can be laid out
    </p>
    <p>
      "Consider the SHOPPING CART pattern. Using this pattern users can manage
      a list of items in a cart. The cart is actually a persistent list of
      items on which users can perform some operations such as delete, view,
      change quantity. This basic behaviour is covered by the L IST B UILDER
      pattern. Similarly, the checkout procedure is actually just a WIZARD with
      specific steps such as ‘specify delivery address’, ‘payment selection’,
      ‘confirm’ etc. The SHOPPING CART is a pattern that aggregates several
      other patterns. This is a form of a “has-a” relationship. The SHOPPING
      CART has a LIST BUILDER and also has a WIZARD ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A pattern may be associated to other patterns because they also often
      occur in the larger context of the design problem, or because the
      patterns are alternatives for the samekind of problems."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When looking at such a networked set of patterns, we can also see layers
      of patterns emerging, when going from high level patterns to lower level
      patterns. These layers are rough delineations of the typical levels that
      are encountered in design. The levels we have identified so far are
      <em><strong>posture</strong></em>, <em><strong>experience</strong></em>,
      <em><strong>task</strong></em> and <em><strong>action</strong></em>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "From experience we know that many sites are actually quite similar in
      the sense that they serve the same goals and have a structurally similar
      site concept. This can be called the site’s
      ‘<em><strong>posture</strong></em>’ (Cooper95), ‘genre’ (van Duyne et al
      2002) or ‘<em>type</em>’." [my bold]
    </p>
    <p>
      "From the basic posture and from user research, designers will have to
      determine what are the <em>main user goals and tasks</em> that need to be
      supported and to what extent. We will call this the
      ‘<em><strong>experience</strong></em>’." [my bold]
    </p>
    <p>
      "The <em><strong>task</strong></em> level is the level where we start to
      see most concrete and well-known patterns such as SHOPPING CART or
      PRODUCT COMPARISON...Typically a task pattern describes a series of
      interactions on one or more objects for solving a problem. Such a series
      corresponds to a task sequence needed to achieve a task goal. Task
      patterns are relatively domain independent." [my emphasis]
    </p>
    <p>
      "<em><strong>action</strong></em> patterns” ...are often similar to
      widgets. They occur is almost all task patterns and are the lowest level
      of building blocks we still want to call a pattern." [my emphasis]
    </p>
    <p>
      "A pattern language can be seen as a mental model (van der Veer &amp;
      Puerta Melguizo, 2002) that a designer has. Writing down design knowledge
      using a pattern language is an activity of making a structured explicit
      representation of ones mental model."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now that we have reached the point where many patterns are available,
      one may wonder how many patterns will need to be added in order to make a
      language ‘complete’...one criterion could be that completeness is reached
      when the available patterns can account for all different qualitatively
      good designs one can find."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We say ‘usable websites’ because we are only interested in describing
      ‘good’ design."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Designers often need to make a decision about a functional aspect and
      may be best served by a set of patterns that can be classified as
      belonging to that functional aspect. Functional aspects may include
      navigation, searching, product display, layout and so on. Most existing
      pattern collections use such an organization...Another organization
      principle is based on usability <em>defect</em>...Clustering by user task
      and user type might also be a relevant organization principle....In
      practice designers often work on a particular site posture and may be
      interested only in patterns that apply to such sites."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For practical use several kinds of pattern classifications may turn out
      to be useful. These are merely different ‘views’ on a language while the
      fundamental pattern relationships are still being respected since those
      are embedded in the patterns themselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In this paper we have used web design as the domain for constructing a
      pattern language but it is also possible to create a similar<br />
      language for GUI design or for designing interface for mobile devices." £
      suggests a way forward for firmware pattern language

      Notes
    </h2>
    <p>
      They make explicit the assumption that interaction design for them
      involves a "2D display", when discussing how whole solutions might break
      down into individual patterns. In the architectural case this can be done
      according to spatial scale. They have ambitions for a hierarchy which
      isn't based on the designs occupying a metric space. The transference of
      patterns from architecture to 'design patterns' in object-oriented
      software design is instructive. It's interesting, however, that something
      intended to help with engagement (clients being able to refer to
      patterns) has ended up within OO being about arcane implementation detail
      where the design alternatives and benefits are principally understood by
      programmers and relate to implementation practices, rather than
      end-results.
