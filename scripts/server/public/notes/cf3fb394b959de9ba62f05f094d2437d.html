      "Our findings show that the amount of effort invested has a direct effect
      (as a result of the extended period of time spent with the product) and
      an indirect effect (via the personalised product’s self-expressive value)
      on the strength of the emotional bond with the product. The paper
      concludes by discussing the implications of these findings for product
      designers."

      "In today’s markets, many consumer durables are comparable with respect
      to their features, quality, and user friendliness. This forces designers
      to find new ways to differentiate their products from competitors."
