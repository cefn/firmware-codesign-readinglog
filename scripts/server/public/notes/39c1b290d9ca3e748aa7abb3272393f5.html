      Relevance
    </h2>
        <p>
      Explicitly links design methodology and software development, suggesting
      that engineering design and critical design perspectives are in conflict
      and not enough is brought in from the creative dimension.

      "Many times, I have reflected on the remarkably bad fit between how the
      process is described in normative process models and methodologies,<br/>
      and how it is performed in practice. As this paper tries to show, I
      attribute the misfit to different views of the external design work,
      i.e., design of the behavior<br/>
      and appearance of the system, the services it offers its users and its
      place in the organization."

        <p>
      "I will argue that the normative models are typically based on an
      engineering<br/>
      design perspective whereas external design in many respects<br/>
      is better described from a creative design perspective.
