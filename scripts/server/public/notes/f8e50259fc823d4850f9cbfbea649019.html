        <p>
      This provides a clear designation of different kinds of interaction
      design work, which should be referenced in the PhD. I think (fearfully)
      my work seems to sit exactly in the middle of this interaction design
      research triangle too.

      "In its very basic form, the model has the shape of a triangle. This
      triangle presents a two-dimensional space for plotting the position of a
      design research activity drawn up in between three extremes: “design
      practice,” “design studies,” and “design exploration.”
    </p>
        <p>
      "we have previously suggested that there also seems to be efforts in
      interaction design research that include synthetic elements as an
      important driving force but which, at the same time, seem to share many
      of the ideals of science. For instance, this is the case when the kind of
      knowledge and user experience sought is the kind that cannot be obtained
      if design—the bringing forth of an artifact such as a research
      prototype—is not a vital part of the research process"

      "On the contrary, in a loop between design practice and design studies,
      for example, the two activities often transpire and feed into each other,
      rendering them almost inseparable. In design practice, a researcher takes
      part in a design practice project, typically working in a team with
      industry constructing an artifact. Wearing the design studies goggles,
      the researcher forms an explicit research question by reflecting on
      previous experiences, issues, and challenges arising in his or her
      current design practice project; and also by taking part in conferences
      and workshops, reading design research literature, discussing with
      colleagues, etc. With the research question in mind, the researcher is
      able to put on the design studies goggles to reflect on what is going on
      in the design practice project."

      "While design studies may call attention to the fact that alternative
      keyboard layouts provide more efficient input, design practice typically
      needs to deal with the fact that QWERTY keyboards are what sell."
    </p>
        <p>
      "True—Real—Possible. If design practice needs to be concerned with what
      is real and design studies with what is true, design exploration instead
      seeks to show what is possible; to show an alternative future; and to
      transcend current paradigms."
