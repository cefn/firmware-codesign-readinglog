    <p>
      The author explores the detailed mechanics of interaction design -
      features which make the intricate steps of interactions go well.
    </p>
    <p>
      One interesting, and relevant, concept in digital design connected to the
      PhD is the notion of the 'rules' of a microinteraction, but Saffer
      doesn't mean this in the sense of code or software behaviour, but rather
      the rules of 'the game' from the point of view of the user who is
      interacting with the interface. In other words, the way the interface
      conditions the user's mental model and behaviour.

    <p>
      "Over the last decade, designers have been encouraged to think big, to
      solve "wicked problems", to use "design thinking" to tackle massive,
      systemic issues in business and in government... ...But by working at
      such a macro scale, an important part of design is often lost: the
      details that delight. Products that we love show an attention to detail:
      the beautiful curve, the satisfying click, the understandable mental
      model."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Microinteractions can be part of a product - or even the entire product
      itself. Take a toaster, for example. A toaster does one thing: toasts. It
      only has one use case: a user puts item to toast into the toaster and
      presses start. Toaster toasts. Toast pups up when done. That's it....the
      whole device is powered by one microinteraction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the mechanical era, users could follow their actions directly from
      the control to the output. You could pull a lever, watch the gears move
      and finally see the wheels turn. It was easy to connect the input to the
      output." [credited to Bill DeRouchey - History of the Button]
    </p>
    <p>
      "Users may wan...the understanding of how [system-initiated triggers]
      operate...they want to know the rules of the microinteraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take what is probably the simplest microinteraction there is: turning on
      a light. Once you use the trigger (a light switch), the light turns on.
      In a basic light setup there is a single rule: the light stays on and
      fully lit until the switch is turned off....the basic turn on switch/turn
      on light rule is very simple, and one that becomes apparent to anyone who
      uses a light, even a child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everything we see or hear while using digital devices is an abstraction.
      Very few of us really know what's happening when we use any kind of
      software or device...you're not really putting a "file" into a "folder"
      and "email" isn't really arriving into your "inbox". Those are all
      metaphors that allow us to understand the interactions that are going
      on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The last part of microinteractions are the <em>loops</em> and
      <em>modes</em> that make up its meta rules."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Signature moments are those microinteractions that are product
      differentiators."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Manual triggers can also be invisible - there might be no label or
      affordance to let the user know there's a microinteraction to be
      triggered. Invisible triggeres are often sensor-based, made possible via
      touchscreens, cameras, microphones, and other sensors such as
      accelerometers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Users shouldn't feel like they have to follow - or worse, memorize - a
      strict set of instructions to achieve the goal. Insteaad what you're
      striving for is a feeling of naturalness, an inevitability, a flow"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's take perhaps the simplest microinteraction there is: turning on a
      light. The rules are these:
    </p>
    <p>
      * When the switch is thrown, the light turns on and stays on.
    </p>
    <p>
      * If the switch is thrown again, turn the light off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It can be helpful to think of your entire microinteraction as a
      sentence. The verbs are the actions that a user can engage in, while the
      nouns are the objects that enable those actions....[example given in
      figure] When friends Like your run on Facebook, you hear cheers in your
      head-phones while using the Nike+ app."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tesler's Law of the Conservation of Complexity....briefly stated, says
      that all activities have an inherent complexity' there is a point beyond
      which you cannot simplify a process any further. The only question
      becomes what to do with that complexity. Either the system handles it and
      thus removes control from the user, or else the user handles it, pushing
      more decisions - yet more control - onto the user."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poka Yoke says that products and processes should be designed so that
      it's impossible for users to commit an error because the product/process
      simply won't allow one." [example, Gmail's you said 'attached' did you
      mean to add an attachment interaction]<br />
      <br />
      Algorithm's are: "Giant decision trees composed of one binary decision
      after another." [credited to Christopher Steiner Automate This: How
      Algorithms Came to Rule Our World]<br />
      <br />
      "Rules create a nontechnical model of the microinteraction. They define
      what can and cannot be done, and in what order"<br />
      <br />
      "...feedback doesn't have to tell users how the microinteraction actually
      works - what the rules actually are - the feedback should be just enough
      for users to make a working mental model of the microinteraction. Along
      with the affordances of the trigger, feedback should let users know what
      they can and cannot do with the microinteraction."<br />
      <br />
      "feedback...communicating to [those] using the product is usually one of
      the following...<br />
      * Something has happened<br />
      * You did something<br />
      * A process has started<br />
      * A process has ended<br />
      * A process is ongoing<br />
      * You can't do that"<br />

      "What does that blinking LED mean? When the icon changes color, what is
      it trying to convey?...Pressing a button to turn on a device and hearing
      a beep is practically meaningless, as there is no relationship between
      the trigger...the resulting action...and the resulting sound."<br />

      "Follow your printed out instructions exactly with your vehicle running.
      Approximately 60 seconds after you begin the installation, you will hear
      an “Installation Complete” message. DO NOT REMOVE your USB drive or turn
      off your vehicle. You must wait an additional 4-18 minutes until you hear
      a second “Installation Complete” message before you can remove your USB
      drive." [from <a href=

      <br />
      The reason to document and prototype any product is to communicate an
      idea: this is how it could (or should) work. With microinteractions, the
      most difficult idea to convey is the overall flow: how all the pieces fit
      together. It's this overall flow that communicates how the
      microinteraction should <em>feel.</em> There are a number of ways to
      accomplish this goal:<em><br />
      Prototype on the platform.</em> If you have technical skills or access to
      them, prototyping on the platform where the microinteraction will live is
      probably the best way to really understand how the microinteraction will
      work. However, it is also likely the most time-consuming way as
      well.<br />
      <em>Make a movie.</em> Movies are fast ways to convey timing and flow.
      They can be actual movies with video and a post-production tool such as
      AfterEffects, or they can be animations, such as those created with
      HTML5<br />
      <em>Create frame-by-frame storyboards.</em> You can also show the
      microinteraction as a set of linked storyboards. While this doesn't show
      timing exactly, it at least demonstrates a sense of movement and shows
      the different states <em>in context</em>."<br />
      <br />
      "Probably the worst way to document a microinteraction is as static
      screenshots. Screenshots convey little of the microinteraction's flow,
      while often removing states from any context that would make them
      understandable. The best documentation tells a story about what is
      happening and why. If you have to use static screenshots or wireframes,
      include keyframes into the documentation [which]...might include the
      trigger, an essential moment in the rules, and how the microinteraction
      ends."<br />
      <br />
      "Microinteractions can also trigger other microinteractions, so that
      there is a kind of "daisy chain" effect, where one microinteraction can
      be the trigger for another, which is itself a trigger for another."<br />
      <br />
      "it can be helpful to have a master list of all the microinteractions
      that need to be designed to make the feature work properly. This can
      often be generated from a task list of flow or from functional
      requirements. From there, you can make a microinteraction map that shows
      how the microinteractions all fit together."<br />
      <br />
      "with microinteractions, because the structure...is important, you need
      as high a fidelity prototype as you can develop in order to test them
      effectively. The links between trigger to rules to feedback to loop are
      tight and not easily separated."<br />
      <br />
      "As with all product testing, you want to watch out for so-called
      "scenario errors", that are caused by the test itself. Since testing is
      an artificial, constructed situation, the setup and guided path the
      tester takes the user down can cause users to make errors or reveal
      problems that normal use would not. As just one example, pausing to ask
      or answer a qu<br />
