      "Design and design research do not primarily focus on explaining the
      world as it is;<br />
      they share with engineering a fundamental interest in focusing on the
      world as it could be. Design fiction is a new approach, which<br />
      integrates these two perspectives, in order to develop a method toolbox
      for design research for a complex world"

      "Design and design research do not primarily focus<br />
      on the world as it is, like most scientific disciplines, trying to
      develop descriptions,<br />
      interpretations, and explanations of existing objects, processes, and
      activities; design and<br />
      design research share with engineering a fundamental interest in focusing
      on the world as it<br />
      could be, on the imagination and realization of possible futures, as well
      as on the disclosure<br />
      of new worlds."
