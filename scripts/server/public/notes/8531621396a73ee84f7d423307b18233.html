      "The concern is that a poorly-constructed user interface will cause
      stress and mental anguish to the end user. Several examples are cited as
      ways in which this can occur. a) The system interface takes control away
      from users and requires them to respond within certain time limits,
      thereby causing stress. b) The system interface does not adequately
      permit the user to recover from mistakes and try again.<br/>
      Nor does it help correct user errors. This leads to a reluctance by users
      to explore or try anything new for fear that they will do something
      catastrophic or "break the system". This further heightens the user's
      sense of stress. c) The system interface is constructed so as to
      intimidate the user by issuing threatening messages or inappropriate
      instructions. This frustrates, angers, and further increases the user's
      stress and dissatisfaction."
