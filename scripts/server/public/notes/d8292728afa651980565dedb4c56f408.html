      "Design fiction allows one to do the design work for things and ideas
      that are<br/>
      too speculative for reasonable, balanced people. They tell stories the
      same way a good<br/>
      science fiction does — immersive, imaginative and imminent."
    </p>
        <p>
      "This kind of prototype has nothing to prove — it does not represent
      technical possibility.<br/>
      The technical prototype serves the purpose of proving whether or not
      instrumental<br/>
      functionality is possible. Design fiction prototyping — or design fiction
      prop making<br/>
      — communicates possibility through the stories it evokes and the
      conversations it starts.<br/>
      The design fiction prototype helps the imagination's capacity to think
      beyond<br/>
      conventional assumptions about what comes next."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Design fiction prototyping fashions tangible, materialized story
      elements that are<br/>
      simultaneously speculative and imminently possible. Design fiction does
      not create<br/>
      specifications for making. Rather design fiction creates specifications
      for imagining."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Design fiction does this by using design to tell stories. It creates
      material artifacts that<br/>
      start conversations and suspend one's disbelief in what could be. It's a
      way of imagining<br/>
      a different kind of world by outlining the contours, rendering the
      artifacts as story props,<br/>
      then using them to imagine new possibilities."
