      "Interpretive research<br/>
      can help IS researchers to understand human<br/>
      thought and action in social and organizational<br/>
      contexts; it has the potential to produce deep<br/>
      insights into information systems phenomena<br/>
      including the management of information systems<br/>
      and information systems development."
    </p>
        <p>
      "This article is our response to some of these questions and suggests a
      set of principles for the conduct and evaluation of interpretive field
      research in information systems."
    </p>
        <p>
      "One of the key contributions of the research methods stream in IS
      research has been the formulation of a set of methodological principles
      for case studies that were consistent with the conventions of positivism
      (Benbasat et al. 1987; Lee 1989; Yin 1994). As a result, case study
      research is now accepted as a valid research strategy within the IS
      research community."
    </p>
        <p>
      "This paper will do the same for interpretive field research, but from
      the philosophical perspective of hermeneutics."
    </p>
        <p>
      "there are many other forms of interpretivism that are not necessarily
      hermeneutic (such as postmodernism or deconstructionism"
    </p>
        <p>
      "It is important to explicitly define what we mean<br/>
      by interpretive research. This is especially so<br/>
      given that often no clear distinction is made<br/>
      between "qualitative" and "interpretive" re-<br/>
      search."
    </p>
        <p>
      "if one follows Chua's (1986) classification of research epistemologies
      into positivist, interpretive, and critical, qualitative research can be
      done with a positivist, interpretive, or critical stance."
    </p>
        <p>
      "IS research can be classified as critical if the main task is seen as
      being one of social critique, whereby the restrictive and alienating
      conditions of the status quo are brought to light."
