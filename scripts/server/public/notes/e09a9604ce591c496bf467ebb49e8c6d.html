    <p>
      "at least a programming language, even&#160;&#160; the worst of
      languages, is executable! Here you have to learn all this monstrous
      complexity&#160; just to build diagrams of a possible future system"
    </p>
    <p>
      "the good thing about bubbles and arrows, as opposed to programs, is that
      they never&#160;crash"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The UML, this&#160; admirable self-feeding machine, devoted from A to Z
      to the creation of a new market, free&#160; of any of the difficulties
      associated with the unpleasant business of software development:&#160;
      UML books! UML courses! Courses on the books! Books on the courses! Books
      on the&#160; books! Introductory courses to prepare for the advanced
      courses! Courses for those who&#160; teach the courses! Revisions! UML
      journals! Conferences! Workshops! Tutorials!&#160; Standards! Committees!
      T-shirts! The more you think about the possibilities, the more&#160;
      dazzling they look."
