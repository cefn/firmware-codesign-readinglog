      "This paper draws on these two strands of research to complement the
      analysis of project-related artefacts as boundary objects with a
      sociomaterial perspective on such objects and the practices within which
      they are constituted."
    </p>
        <p>
      "The contribution of this combined approach is illustrated using the
      findings of a longitudinal case study of IS development. We trace the
      production and use of a prototype, the various people and practices with
      which it was associated, the multiple sociomaterial configurations that
      constituted it as a boundary object, and the social and material
      consequences of its use."
