      Quotations
    </h2>
        <p>
      "The embedded and information systems communi-<br/>
      ties tend to exist in almost complete isolation from one<br/>
      another. This holds for conferences as well as for organiza-<br/>
      tion layout and products"
    </p>
        <p>
      "Embedded-software engineers...rather attend<br/>
      their domain-specific events, such as the SAE Conver-<br/>
      gence series, because they relate software engineering to<br/>
      specific industry domain challenges and solutions."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Embedded microprocessors account for more than 98<br/>
      percent of all produced microprocessors, thus vastly sur-<br/>
      passing computing power in the IT industry."
    </p>
        <p>
      "new cars currently have 20 to 70 electronic control units with more than
      100 million object code instructions, totaling close to 1 Gbyte of
      software in a premium car."
    </p>
        <p>
      "While mechanical defects are decreasing in rate, defects caused by
      electronic systems are increasing rapidly."
    </p>
        <p>
      "There are many informal claims for tools, languages, and
      methodologies,<br/>
      but empirical data on their actual effectiveness in terms<br/>
      of quality or productivity is rarely collected."
    </p>
        <p>
      "The main source of [embedded software systems'] complexity is the large
      number of<br/>
      subtle and often unexpected interactions among the<br/>
      various parts of these systems, which have the following<br/>
      common features:<br/>
      •     functionality represented by states and
      events;<br/>
      •     real-time behavior of events and expected
      actions;<br/>
      •     combined software/hardware systems
      equipped<br/>
      with distributed software, computers, sensors, and<br/>
      actuators;<br/>
      •     high demands on availability, safety,
      information se-<br/>
      curity, and interoperability; and<br/>
      •     long-lived systems in which embedded software
      is<br/>
      expected to work reliably"
    </p>
        <p>
      "embedded developers often do not<br/>
      really consider themselves “software engineers.” By train-<br/>
      ing, many of them are electrical engineers, automotive<br/>
      engineers, or telecommunications engineers, or have<br/>
      some other background. They don’t want to be viewed<br/>
      as software engineers because software engineering has<br/>
      a lower professional status than more mature forms of<br/>
      engineering—particularly the types of engineering that<br/>
      have certification and licensing requirements"
    </p>
        <p>
      "There have been serious issues with medical instruments, an-<br/>
      tilock brakes, and home appliances. Failures and poor<br/>
      quality in embedded software can sometimes cause death<br/>
      or serious injury."
    </p>
        <p>
      "The two major cost drivers in embedded-software de-<br/>
      velopment are requirements and test."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Requirements are the single major<br/>
      driver. We often develop the wrong things due to not<br/>
      reviewing and analyzing requirements, missing and vague<br/>
      requirements, or confusing needs and requirements. Forty<br/>
      percent of all software defects in embedded systems result<br/>
      from insufficient requirements and analysis activities."
    </p>
        <p>
      "Embedded software has tremendous impact. It de-<br/>
      termines value and risks in many of today’s products,<br/>
      independent of domain and usage. If done well, it is invis-<br/>
      ible and makes people spend money for the product. The<br/>
      equation is simple: More embedded software in a product<br/>
      increases sales and market share. But one wrong bit out<br/>
      of billions can bring a system down and can cause physi-<br/>
      cal damage"
