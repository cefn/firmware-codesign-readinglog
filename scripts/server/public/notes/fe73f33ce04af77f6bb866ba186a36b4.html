    <p>
      This is a philosophical piece which tries to nail down a taxonomy of
      imaging, including pictures, mental images, drawing and sketching.

      "imaging and imagery...are often thought of as...mainsprings of insight
      and originality in design activity"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is in the picture-<br />
      frame is canvas, pigmented surface and so on; but what is in the
      picture,<br />
      that is, what it pictures, brings us to the threshold of a domain we
      cannot<br />
      enter unless we have grasped the concept of ‘picturing’, until we
      have<br />
      understood the function of a picture as a representation device 16 . If
      we<br />
      find this puzzling or surprising, then we should bear in mind that a
      picture<br />
      bears much more resemblance to the other ordinary material objects
      that<br />
      surround it than what it pictures. To be able to understand and use
      pictures<br />
      we must first acquire the requisite techniques of usage and this we
      do<br />
      partly by learning how to make pictures ourselves and also by
      attending<br />
      to the many uses of pictures in our culture. The central point here, is
      that<br />
      the capacity to see the content of pictures, what is ‘in’ them is a
      learned<br />
      capacity, acquired, like other usages of symbols (and language more<br />
      generally) through mastery of these techniques."
    </p>
    <p>
      "to<br />
      see what is in the picture, it must become ‘transparent’ to us in a
      sense<br />
      which transcends the transparency of the primary conceptual field. To
      do<br />
      this one must grasp the use of the picture as a representational device,
      to<br />
      be able to see what is in the picture, that is, what it pictures. In
      grasping<br />
      this use of the picture, it becomes epistemically transparent and we
      have<br />
      learned a new skill which is (logically) quite distinct from that of
      the<br />
      ‘informationally reliable’ reportage of the primary conceptual field."
    </p>
    <p>
      "some pictures may be set up to offer a completely<br />
      unitary and unambiguous point-of-view; for example, an engineering
      draw-<br />
      ing or a set of explicit written instructions. When we view such a
      picture<br />
      it is intended (usually) that we only see it from one such possible
      point-<br />
      of-view. But in order for a picture to function, it is not vital that it
      has a<br />
      unitary epistemic stance as such. Indeed, many kinds of picture thrive
      on<br />
      ambiguities; they offer the possibility of a diversity of points-of-view.
      Thus<br />
      a viewer may contemplate the picture as representing different
      possibilities<br />
      (differing points-of-view) and different viewers may also ‘see’
      different<br />
      things in the picture."
    </p>
    <p>
      "‘ambiguity’, far from being an accidental by-product of the techniques
      of picturing, has the potential to lead into<br />
      entirely new domains; through this enhanced use of pictures we
      acquire<br />
      the power to express what-might-be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "if the discourse we employ with respect to concepts<br />
      such as imaging, imagery and other mental, psychological states could
      only<br />
      ever be applied to ‘inner’ essentially private phenomena, then it would
      be<br />
      impossible to make sense of it. If our ordinary everyday language is
      to<br />
      have any use for us, it must refer to a domain we can all share."
