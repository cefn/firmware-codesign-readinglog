      Offers a catalog of design materials suggested with Ehn and others
      referenced. Needs exploring fully to consider possible techniques to
      transfer to firmware.

    <p>
      "co-designing is very often supported by various types of tangible<br />
      working materials –here called “design materials” like<br />
      phrased by Halse [8]. Some can be characterizes as being<br />
      “raw” and/or “metaphorical”; such as pen and paper, post-it<br />
      notes, foam blocks, clay, disposable cups, pipe cleaners,<br />
      small-scale person icons, game-pieces, tennis balls, hats,<br />
      etc.; while for example printed (field) images, access to<br />
      video-clips, foam &amp; paper mock-ups, prototypes, etc could<br />
      be called “pre-designed” design materials. Whatever the<br />
      starting point, they are all viewed as objects, which are<br />
      explored, combined and added meaning during co-design<br />
      activities."
    </p>
    <p>
      "various others have explored and<br />
      named design materials. Generally Ehn [7] argues that they<br />
      can establish shared “Language games” and in a broad<br />
      sense Star argues that they can become “boundary objects”among the
      participants of various disciplinary backgrounds<br />
      [12]. More practically, for example Brandt calls design<br />
      materials “Things-to-think-with” [3], Capjon phrase them<br />
      “Communication catalysts” [5] and Sanders use “Make"
    </p>
    <p>
      "the work presented should be viewed as an input<br />
      for making small-scale material-methodological decisions<br />
      when planning and preparing co-design activities, formats<br />
      and design materials"
    </p>
    <p>
      "explicit considerations of what is designed “for” and what<br />
      is designed “by” co-designers, can play a role in creating<br />
      engagement and shared ownership in a co-design project"
