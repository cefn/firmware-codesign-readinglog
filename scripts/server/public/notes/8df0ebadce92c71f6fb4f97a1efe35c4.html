      "The purpose of this special issue is therefore to revisit the concept
      [of Boundary Object] in order to look at its analytical scope whilst
      taking care to maintain the close articulation between interpretive
      flexibility and infrastructure."

      "One of the first to return to the notion was Kathryn Henderson in an
      anthropology of the design activity (Henderson, 1991, 1998a). She is
      particularly interested in visual representations – drawings and diagrams
      – produced to organise discussions and move collective work forward.
      These are elements which facilitate the distributed cognitive process
      because they facilitate the crossover between interpretations held by the
      different professional groups involved in the design of a turbine. In her
      work (Henderson, 1998b), she explores the impact of computer-assisted
      design tools on visual design culture."
