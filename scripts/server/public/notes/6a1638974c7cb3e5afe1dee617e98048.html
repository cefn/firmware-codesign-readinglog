      In design-oriented research, the knowledge that comes from<br />
      studying the designed artifact in use or from the process of<br />
      bringing the product into being should be seen as the main<br />
      contribution—the ‘result’—while the artifact that has been<br />
      developed becomes more of a means than an end.<br />
      Typically, this implies that the artifact that is developed does<br />
      not need to encompass all services, functions, and level of<br />
      completeness that a final ‘product’ would need to embrace.<br />
      The design-oriented researcher hence works with sketches and<br />
      prototypes of different kinds, depending on what aspects are<br />
      investigated. Hence, sometimes a brick could be used to sketch<br />
      a mobile phone; a piece of paper may be used as a screen; and<br />
      a wholly faked interface may be controlled not by an<br />
      application but by an experimenter hiding behind a curtain.
