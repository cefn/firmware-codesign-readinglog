        <p>
      "We describe "Experience Prototyping" as a form of prototyping that
      enables design team members, users and clients to gain first-hand
      appreciation of existing or future conditions through active engagement
      with prototypes"
    </p>
        <p>
      "we find ourselves stretching the limits of prototyping tools to explore
      and communicate what it will be like to interact with the things we
      design"
