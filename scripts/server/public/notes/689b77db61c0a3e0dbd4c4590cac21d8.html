      "The relevant literature is reviewed to gather an understanding of the
      notion of the user’s impractical needs and aspirations, such as social,
      hedonistic, and emotional values and the meanings users attach to a
      product in a certain context. In addition, existing methods with similar
      aims are reviewed."

      "With task-related goals, it has been self-evident to emphasise the
      user’s utility values, such as achievement and efficiency, in design.
      However, it is increasingly clear that the uses of computing technology
      are reaching far beyond productive tools to support work to other aspects
      of human life. Aspects such as providing rewarding social interactions
      and addressing the concerns of society as a whole are regarded as
      important "

      excitement, pleasure, fun, and beauty into people’s lives"
