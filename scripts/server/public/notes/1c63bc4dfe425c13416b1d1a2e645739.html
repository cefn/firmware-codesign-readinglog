      "Once design becomes a process handled by a group of specialists and
      non-specialists, particular communication skills are needed in order to
      bring about a productive co-creational setting that does not give way to
      a hierarchical structure."

      "Design by/for Participation This plane of design entails not only
      participatory methods and techniques for engaging at design time the user
      community in the initial setting of the participative system, but also
      participative support mechanisms for encouraging participantsâ€™ engagement
      and design activities at use time. At this level, metadesigners and
      participants play a more fluid role in the design activity. An instance
      of design for participation is, for example, the design of mechanisms in
      support of reflective activities. These mechanisms can be either
      computational (i.e. embedded in a software system) or social (i.e.
      embedded in media for social interaction)."
