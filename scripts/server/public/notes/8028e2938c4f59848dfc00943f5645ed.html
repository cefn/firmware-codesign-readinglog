        <p>
      A great book, endlessly referenced in the context of design thinking.
      Needs reading from cover to cover.

      "Fricke (1993, 1996), from protocol studies of engineering designers,
      found that<br/>
      both generating few alternative concepts and generating a large number
      of<br/>
      alternatives were equally weak strategies, leading to poor design
      solutions."
    </p>
        <p>
      "When the problem was precisely specified, designers generated more
      solution variants;<br/>
      whereas with an imprecise assignment (for the same design task),
      designers tended<br/>
      to generate few alternative solution concepts."
