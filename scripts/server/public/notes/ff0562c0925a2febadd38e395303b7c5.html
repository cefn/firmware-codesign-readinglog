      ""Structure" is one of the most important and most elusive terms in
      the<br />
      vocabulary of current social science. The concept is central not only
      in<br />
      such eponymous schools as structural functionalism, structuralism,
      and<br />
      poststructuralism, but in virtually all tendencies of social
      scientific<br />
      thought. But if social scientists find it impossible to do without the
      term<br />
      "structure," we also find it nearly impossible to define it adequately."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The term structure empowers what it designates. Structure, in its
      nom-<br />
      inative sense, always implies structure in its transitive verbal sense."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A social science trapped in an unexamined metaphor<br />
      of structure tends to reduce actors to cleverly programmed automatons."
    </p>
    <p>
      "structural language lends itself readily to explanations of how social
      life is shaped into consistent patterns, but not to explanations of how
      these patterns change over time. In structural dis-<br />
      course, change is commonly located outside of structures, either in a
      telos<br />
      of history, in notions of breakdown, or in influences exogenous to
      the<br />
      system in question. Consequently, moving from questions of stability
      to<br />
      questions of change tends to involve awkward epistemological shifts"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sociologists typi-<br />
      cally contrast "structure" to "culture." Structure, in normal
      sociological<br />
      usage, is thought of as "hard" or "material" and therefore as
      primary<br />
      and determining, whereas culture is regarded as "soft" or "mental"
      and<br />
      therefore as secondary or derived"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This article will attempt to develop a theory of structure that
      overcomes<br />
      the three cardinal weaknesses of the concept as it is normally
      employed<br />
      in social science. The theory will attempt (1) to recognize the agency
      of<br />
      social actors, (2) to build the possibility of change into the concept
      of<br />
      structure, and (3) to overcome the divide between semiotic and
      materialist visions of structure"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Structures shape people's practices, but it is also people's<br />
      practices that constitute (and reproduce) structures." [credited to
