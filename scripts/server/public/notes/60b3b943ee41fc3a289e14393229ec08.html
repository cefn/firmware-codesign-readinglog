      "Requirements Engineering (RE), a branch of software engineering that
      deals with<br />
      elicitation, refinement, analysis, etc. of software systems requirements
      gained a lot of<br />
      attention in the academia as well as in the industry."

      "requirements engineering is defined in [47] as the process of
      discovering the purpose of<br />
      software systems by identifying stakeholders (“people or organizations
      who will be affected<br />
      by the system and who have a direct or indirect influence on the system
      requirements” [43])<br />
      and their needs and by documenting these in a form that is amenable to
      analysis,"
