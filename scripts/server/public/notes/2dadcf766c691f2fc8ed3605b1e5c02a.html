      "Designers, during a conceptual design process, do not just
      synthesize<br/>
      solutions that satisfy initially given requirements, but also invent
      design<br/>
      issues or requirements that capture important aspects of the given<br/>
      problem. How do they do this?...attending to visuo-spatial features in
      sketches<br/>
      which were not intended when they were drawn, are believed to<br/>
      contribute to it."
