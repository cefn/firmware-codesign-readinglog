      Magazine Article on Elizabeth Stokoe's CARM Method
    </p>
    <p>
      First heard about this technique through Radio 4 'Life Scientific'
      programme. Uses replay of actual recorded conversations to lead people
      through more authentic role-play scenarios. Strong relationship with
      leading paraglider pilots through logged flights as scenario generation
      and engagement strategy.

      Quotations
    </h2>
    <p>
      "The people in the training workshop live through the call as it happened
      without knowing what's going to happen next. I show them what happens
      next."
    </p>
    <p>
      "if you can't intuit what you would do in a situation, how can you
      construct an entire hypothetical role play and make it look anythying
      like the situation you're really going to deal with?"
