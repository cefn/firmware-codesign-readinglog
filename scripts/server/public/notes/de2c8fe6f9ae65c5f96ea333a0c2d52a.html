      Discusses the use of Agile methods for embedded systems and firmware in
      particular, and comments on quality and design process structure issues
      in ways which are resonant with the core critical discourse of the PhD.
      Important to read and follow reference trail of this paper, although it
      seems rather naive in terms of its unreferenced assertions from time to
      time.

      Quotations
    </h2>
    <p>
      "The term firmware is used to describe the low-level software in embedded
      systems."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Software development for [embedded systems] has special characteristics
      such as a culture of hacking, small teams and multiple hats, co-design
      issues, one-time designs, correctness and robustness requirements, lack
      of tools and unconventional customers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Firmware code<br />
      is not understood as real software, when in fact it is the<br />
      extreme end of software development. It has to not only<br />
      consider all the aspects that mainstream programmers do, but<br />
      also deal with real-time requirements and struggle with them<br />
      in an environment of very limited hardware resources." Â£ relevant to
      understanding the focus of firmware engineers on implementation rather
      than design?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Feedback. XP emphasizes the effect of feedback. Feedback<br />
      is given all the time during the project. Programmers get<br />
      feedback in minutes or even seconds from their unit testing.<br />
      On-site customer gets feedback about new user stories<br />
      immediately in form of effort estimates. The product is put to<br />
      production in small releases as soon as possible to get<br />
      feedback and so on. Collective code ownership and<br />
      continuous integration furthermore help to get immediate<br />
      feedback. Feedback of course is strongly related to good<br />
      communication."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Primary goals for firmware project should be rapid value,<br />
      and feedback from customer. Firmware projects are often<br />
      developing something unique, and no one has a clear picture<br />
      of what it is supposed to be like. This means that projects are<br />
      extremely difficult to predict. The best way to get the<br />
      evolution of the idea on its way is to build a prototype based<br />
      on the best guess on requirements. Customers need to learn to<br />
      understand and use this powerful tool. Same applies to<br />
      developers to learn not to over develop prototypes before the<br />
      first release, but instead deliver it for review and get feedback<br />
      sooner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Developers of firmware software are said to be skilled on a<br />
      different aspect than say for example database programmers.<br />
      In firmware project when a programmer saves a byte of<br />
      executable code or cuts a microsecond from executing time he<br />
      is considered skilled. In this fashion it is clear that firmware<br />
      developers are not performing in skills that are normally<br />
      learned in computer science studies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Culture in firmware projects is at least very close to pure<br />
      hacking. Projects are fired away in build-and-fix manner."
