      "A useful definition is also provided by Kleinsmann and Valkenburg, who
      described co-design as ‘the process in which actors from different
      disciplines share their knowledge about both the design process and the
      design content ... in order to create shared understanding on both
      aspects ... and to achieve the larger common objective: the new product
      to be designed’"
    </p>
        <p>
      "What happens in (co-)design can be understood more adequately as a
      process of abduction—a term coined by pragmatist philosopher C.S. Peirce,
      which refers to a type of reasoning that is different from deduction or
      induction: ‘deduction proves that something must be; induction shows that
      something actually is operative; abduction merely suggests that something
      may be.’"
    </p>
        <p>
      "In design thinking, problems and possible solutions are explored and
      developed and evaluated simultaneously in an iterative process:"
    </p>
        <p>
      "Dewey distinguished between primary experiences of ‘gross, macroscopic,
      crude subject-matters’, that is, experiences ‘as the result of a minimum
      of incidental<br/>
      reflection’, and secondary experiences of ‘refined, derived objects of
      reflection’, that is, experiences ‘in consequence of continued and
      regulated reflective inquiry’. Furthermore, Dewey promoted an ‘empirical
      method’ of moving back and forth between practices (primary experiences)
      and reflections (secondary experiences) in order to develop practical
      knowledge: knowledge that is based on practices and that is practically
      applicable."
