      Also it would be great to get hold of a copy of either "Kinds of Seeing
      in Designing" <i>Creativity and Innovation Management,</i> Vol. 1, No. 2,
      June, 1992 or "Kinds of Seeing and their Functions in Designing"

      Volume 13, Issue 2</a>, April 1992, Pages 135–156 with Glen Wiggins<br/>
            <br/>
      Gero and Saunders summarise their thoughts..."Schön and Wiggins
      enumerated three kinds of seeing, literal apprehension of
      representations, apprehension of figures, and appreciative judgements of
      quality. To these different kinds of seeing they also added the<br/>
      recognition of unintended consequences of design actions."<br/>
