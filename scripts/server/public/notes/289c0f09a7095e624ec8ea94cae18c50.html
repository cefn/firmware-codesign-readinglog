      Notes
    </h2>
    <p>
      This addresses strict 'computer science' in the sense of algorithm and
      device design, and bemoans the lack of mathematical grounding in formal
      methods, bad science (from the point of view of experiment design).
    </p>
    <p>
      I find the scope of this paper unstated, unclear and confusing. The
      author doesn't identify himself with any specific discipline within
      Software Engineering, meaning the colleagues he's addressing might be
      from anywhere from Mathematical logic to STSS.<br />
      <br />
      Superficially this would be relevant to my field, but seems to be
      discussing software engineering rather than requirements capture or
      design, and seems to overlook both amazingly when scoping the extent of
      relevance of empirical study.<br />
