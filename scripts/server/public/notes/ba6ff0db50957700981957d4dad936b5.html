      "Practicing Test Driven Development is much more about setting concrete,
      detailed expectations in advance, and allowing those expectations of code
      behavior to guide the implementation than it is about testing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In ATDD, the team creates one or more acceptance-level tests for a
      feature before beginning work on it. Typically these tests are discussed
      and captured when the team is working with the business stakeholder(s) 1
      to understand a story on the backlog.
