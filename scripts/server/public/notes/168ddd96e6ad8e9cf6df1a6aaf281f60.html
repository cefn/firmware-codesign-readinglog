      A Cultural Studies piece which approaches how to think about computers
      within a historical and cultural context, linking them to magic.

      "Digital computers are an electronic manifestation of a far older
      cultural practice:&#160;&#160; the invocation. An invocation is an event
      that begins with a call, and ends with a&#160;&#160; becoming. An
      invocation is when some entity calls on another entity to
      execute&#160;&#160; a task. It is a point of decision that delegates a
      task to something outside the&#160;&#160; subject. It is characterised by
      a power relation and a language act. The digital&#160;&#160; computer is
      a media form characterised by its capacity to mediate invocations. "

      "Most genealogies of computers trace the computer’s genesis to traditions
      of&#160; symbolic abstraction: mathematics, physics and engineering
      (Randell 1982). I&#160;&#160; think it is equally productive to look to a
      wider range of cultural practices&#160;including techniques and
      technologies, language, and magic."

      "An invocatory device puts&#160; a part of the world at the user’s
      command. It reliably calls up a certain effect&#160; with a minimal
      effort. People make delegations to invocatory devices in the
      faith&#160;&#160; that they will be answered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Invocational practices often recall speech in a more abstract way.
      Invocational media operate entirely through ‘calls’, even&#160;&#160; if
      they are not heard by human ears. Programmers invoke calls to
      subroutines,&#160;&#160; peripheral devices and remote services.
      Interfaces offer a silent call and response&#160; — a command entered on
      the keyboard is answered by an image on screen"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Invocational media develop as a kind of hyper-extended invocatory
      device.&#160; Where an invocatory device invokes a single, named effect
      (ringing a door bell,&#160; turning on a light, playing a note),
      invocational media insert an interval of&#160; indeterminacy between a
      user’s invocations and the invoked effects. The user’s&#160; command is
      delegated to a specialised component, the central processing unit,&#160;
      and is stored up in memory devices (see Chapter Four). The decision
      that&#160; invokes the output from that command is deferred, sometimes
      for milliseconds,&#160; and other times for an extended period. The CPU
      and memory separate input&#160; from output, opening up the invocational
      space for quasi-linguistic computer&#160; languages which articulate
      complex logical and arithmetical transformations&#160; and conditional
      effects. This move from single invocatory effects to invocational&#160;
      sequences fuses command, memory and decision to create the general
      purpose&#160; computer. Beyond this threshold these devices become
      invocational media."

      "there is a hidden dogmatism behind the imperative to have a particular
      kind of critical position...The modern university can be almost as rigid
      as the system that preceded it...Anyone writing a PhD in [Cultural
      Studies] needs to find a way to become a specialist in not being a
      specialist."<br />

      "You can’t assume that the field exists prior to the work that
      constitutes that field."<br />
