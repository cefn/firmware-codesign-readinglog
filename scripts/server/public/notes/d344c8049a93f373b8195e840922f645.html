      Notes
    </h2>
        <p>
      They explore 'sensing systems' as examples of devices without GUI, but
      <em>
                <strong>WITH</strong>
            </em> behaviour, from an interaction design
      point of view. A focus is dialogue-controlled devices. Open questions are
      around what state the system is in, and how it would know your intent
      toward it, and you would know it's intent too.
