      "In our survey of 259 designers, 86% reported that the behavior is more
      difficult to prototype than the appearance. Often (78% of<br />
      the time), designing the behavior requires collaborating with developers,
      but 76% of designers reported that communicating the behavior to
      developers was more difficult than the appearance. Other results include
      that annotations such as arrows and paragraphs of text are used on top of
      sketches and storyboards to explain behaviors, and designers want to
      explore multiple versions of behaviors, but today’s tools make this
      difficult."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There have been many previous studies of the processes, techniques and
      tools that are used by designers, but none have focused on how the
      interactive behavior of the interface is created and communicated.
      Creating the behaviors inherently deals with programming concepts, such
      as conditionality (e.g., behaviors that only happen if the user interface
      is in a certain mode), and abstrac-<br />
      tion (e.g., a behavior should happen when users click on any object of a
      particular type)."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Designers can be classified as end-user programmers (EUP), since they do
      not write programs as a primary goal, but rather in<br />
      support of designing a web page or an animation"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For example, tools for early design focused on use by designers who are
      not programmers include SILK [11], Electronic Cocktail<br />
      Napkin [8], DENIM [14], SketchWizard [7], DEMAIS [2], Designer’s Outpost
      [10], and many others."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Designing the behaviors was reported to be an ongoing process while
      designing appearance is a simpler process of creating a single static
      image. Behaviors were said to often remain ill-defined until the
      application is actually implemented"

      "[Verbatims where designers express issues with defining interactions]
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Interactions must be specified at a low-level of detail:
      </li>
      <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
        <ul>
          <li>“Details are important, and you never have them all until full
          implementation.”
          </li>
          <li>“There are so many factors that can influence the behavior. It
          isn’t a controlled event and [it’s] very difficult to communicate the
          entire experience via a prototype.
          </li>
          <li>“Because of the many different states that must be demonstrated
          and their dependence on different conditions preceding those states.”
          </li>
          <li>“It’s more complex with more variables and constraints attached.
          There are also more stakeholders and coworkers involved”
          </li>
          <li>“It’s harder for people to fill in the gaps with imagination.
          Small changes make big differences in experiential outcomes so if
          something is not quite right it can cloud whole thing.”
          </li>
          <li>“There’s no such thing as low-fidelity interaction, it has to be
          right.”
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Difficulty with today’s tools:
      </li>
      <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
        <ul>
          <li>“I work in mobile, so often I have to wait until developers have
          something working before I can actually test out how a new behavior
          ‘feels’ on a phone. What it looks like is easy to test by just
          putting a picture of the mockup onto the phone.”
          </li>
          <li>“Current tools for defining behavior suck.”
          </li>
          <li>“I can represent very exactly the desired appearance. However, I
          can only approximate the backend behaviors.”
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The richness of the interactions themselves..."
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      "55% of the participants said that they had had an interactive behavior
      they wanted to explore on paper but could not, and therefore had to
      explore by implementing it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "participants also agreed that sketches and storyboards were not
      sufficient for exploring interactive behaviors, consistent with previous
      studies (e.g., [2, 4])."
    </p>
    <p>
      "people can imagine the final detailed appearance even from a vague
      sketch; however, it is very hard to communicate behavior and to get a
      sense of the final version from a prototype"
    </p>
    <p>
      "designers frequently wanted to have multiple designs side-by-side,
      either in their sketchbooks, on big displays, or on the wall. However,
      this is difficult to achieve for behaviors – there is no built-in way in
      today’s implementation tools to have two versions of a behavior operating
      side-by-side."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our results suggest that there is definitely a need among designers for
      quickly and easily prototyping interactive behaviors. Many do not
      program, and have difficulty prototyping behaviors. Consequently, they
      resort to heavy use of annotations and other means for communicating
      their intentions to people who do program. Specifying behaviors textually
      is often inadequate, time-consuming and sometimes leads to
      miscommunication and confusion between designers and developers. Since
      designers strive to be creative and<br />
      explore new and complex behaviors, this is a significant pain point for
      them both today and in the future."
