      &#160;Relates also to a paper by the same author which I don't have
      access to at Lancaster, but looks perhaps a bit more directly relevant
      (engineers and the design process are explicit here)...

      Intermediary object is an interesting, perhaps linked, concept to that of
      'boundary object' - seems to have more of a theme of an organising
      object, part of the process of work, such as a folder or a crate, as a
      foil for mapping organisational activity.<br />
