      "This paper describes the vital role of freehand sketching in the<br/>
      design process. When designers first tackle a design problem<br/>
      they usually do so by sketching. We will explore the essential<br/>
      elements of sketching that make it so helpful to problem solving.<br/>
      We then examine how current computer interfaces interfere with<br/>
      the sketching process, and go on to establish the requirements<br/>
      for an environment to support sketching. Finally we describe a<br/>
      system under development to integrate sketching into a visual<br/>
      programming environment (Visual Basic)."
