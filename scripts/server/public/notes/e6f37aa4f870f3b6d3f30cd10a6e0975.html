        <p>
      They discuss 'critical design' as introduced by Dunne and Raby, but try
      to set it in the context of a history of critical thought. Critical
      design is described as a design practice which subverts the status quo,
      in other words, channels the work of the designer against global
      capitalism.

        <p>
      "Critical design, like Frankfurt School critical theory before it, is a
      research strategy dedicated to transgressing and undermining social
      conformity, passivity, and similar values of capitalist ideology, in
      hopes of bringing about social emancipation."
    </p>
        <p>
      "capitalism is extremely fast at appropriating countercultural signifiers
      and commercializing them for the mainstream...[for example] 
      digitally enabled designer sex toys, the (capitalist) designers of which
      are collaborating with feminist activists, sexual health experts, and the
      public to design devices that simultaneously transgress against
      mainstream sexual norms and also provide consumers very simple pleasures"
    </p>
        <p>
      "Critical theorists commonly use three methodological strategies to do
      their work. The starting point is what Carroll calls “the hermeneutics of
      suspicion,”...the deployment of dialectics that foreground conflicts and
      historical specificity within societies, eras,<br/>
      situations, events, etc., which are normally presented as unified and
      timeless...A related methodological approach is utopian<br/>
      thinking, which imagines realistic but genuinely better worlds or
      societies,"
