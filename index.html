<h1>Boundary Objects for Firmware Co-Design</h1>
<p>This reading log records the papers, concepts, methodologies and disciplines which are relevant to Cefn Hoile's above-titled PhD topic. A hypertext structure has been chosen to accommodate the many relevant aspects, perspectives and interwoven concepts arising from the literature.</p>
<p>The scope of the PhD can be understood in many different ways, but boils down to establishing <i><b>best practice for manufacturers to engage end-users directly in the design of device firmware</b></i>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The approach aims to avoid the ambiguities and consequent execution errors which plague specifications-driven firmware design processes. The core strategy is to enable end-users to encounter and resolve those ambiguities themselves in a way which constrains downstream development. Ideally the outputs from user-centred co-design workshops would be able to be directly incorporated in products without additional design steps or interpretation. To achieve this, <b><i>well-chosen boundary objects are critical</i></b> in at least three phases of the task;</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><i><b>Disclosure</b></i> - the exposition and education of participants about the challenges and approaches central to the design task. Here boundary objects may catalyse an accessible mental framework for previously untrained participants.</li>
<li><b><i>Engagement</i></b> - as end-users, engineers and facilitators collaborating on defining and addressing the design task. Here, boundary objects provide a transactional medium for storytelling, critique and may help to impose realistic constraints on the participants design activities.</li>
<li><b><i>Downstreaming</i></b> - here, boundary objects are the structures and representations handed on to engineers to inform them and enable them to deliver the final product as defined in the Engagement phase. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The scope assumes that the target users are not themselves programmers, and cannot therefore perform the same function as a trained firmware engineer. Natural concernes&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, the effort invested and evidence gathered should be able to be exploited by manufacturers of firmware-driven products to guide their decision-making when specifying firmware.</p>
